Paragraphs:
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).
As well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration.
Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data.
Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server.
There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
After the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.
In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, JumpStation was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot.
In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.
Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions.
The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).
Static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using socket programming.
Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[3] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.
By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as Xpath can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.
There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of ""bots"" for specific verticals with no ""man in the loop"" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
The pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[4] are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[5]
Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning. This method enables more intelligent and flexible data extraction, accommodating complex and dynamic web content.
The world of web scraping offers a variety of software tools designed to simplify and customize the process of data extraction from websites. These tools vary in their approach and capabilities, making web scraping accessible to both novice users and advanced programmers.
Some advanced web scraping software can automatically recognize the data structure of a web page, eliminating the need for manual coding. Others provide a recording interface that allows users to record their interactions with a website, thus creating a scraping script without writing a single line of code. Many tools also include scripting functions for more customized extraction and transformation of content, along with database interfaces to store the scraped data locally.
Web scraping tools are versatile in their functionality. Some can directly extract data from APIs, while others are capable of handling websites with AJAX-based dynamic content loading or login requirements. Point-and-click software, for instance, empowers users without advanced coding skills to benefit from web scraping. This democratizes access to data, making it easier for a broader audience to leverage the power of web scraping.
Some platforms provide not only tools for web scraping but also opportunities for developers to share and potentially monetize their scraping solutions. By leveraging these tools and platforms, users can unlock the full potential of web scraping, turning raw data into valuable insights and opportunities.
[6]
The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[7]
In the United States, website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA""), and (3) trespass to chattel.[8] However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.
U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of ""scrapers"" or ""robots"" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[9][10] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[11]
One of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[12] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[13]
Southwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of ""Computer Fraud and Abuse"" and has led to ""Damage and Loss"" and ""Unauthorized Access"" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes ""Interference with Business Relations"", ""Trespass"", and ""Harmful Access by Computer"". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as ""Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment"", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[14] In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in Craigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[15]
While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[16] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[17] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly ""excessively crawled"" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[18] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.
In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[19]
In Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[20][21] In Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.
The Ninth Circuit ruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA in hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in Van Buren v. United States which narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[22] On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[23]
Internet Archive collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.[citation needed]
In February 2006, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[24]
In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law. In the case of Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland's High Court ruled Ryanair's ""click-wrap"" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[25] The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[26]
On April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[27] The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[28]
In Australia, the Spam Act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[29][30]
Leaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate the Information Technology Act, 2000, which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource.

Popular Web Scraping Tools
BeautifulSoup: A Python library that provides simple methods for extracting data from HTML and XML files.
Scrapy: An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python that allows you to extract the data, process it, and store it.
Octoparse: A no-code web scraping tool that offers a user-friendly interface for extracting data from websites without needing programming skills.
ParseHub: Another no-code web scraper that can handle dynamic content and works with AJAX-loaded sites.
Apify: A platform that offers a wide range of scraping tools and the ability to create custom scrapers.
InstantAPI.ai: An AI-powered tool that transforms any web page into personalized APIs instantly, offering advanced data extraction and customization.
Blocking an IP address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and DNSRBL. This will also block all browsing from that address.
Disabling any web service API that the website's system might expose.
Bots sometimes declare who they are (using user agent strings) and can be blocked on that basis using robots.txt; 'googlebot' is an example. Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.
Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic
Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a CAPTCHA. Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges. They can be triggered because the bot is: 1) making too many requests in a short time, 2) using low-quality proxies, or 3) not covering the web scraper’s fingerprint properly.[31]
Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well. However, many such solutions are not very effective.[32]
Locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.
Obfuscation using CSS sprites to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses, at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users.
Because bots rely on consistency in the front-end code of a target website, adding small variations to the HTML/CSS surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process.
Websites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the robots.txt file and allow partial access, limit the crawl rate, specify the optimal time to crawl and more.

Paragraphs:

Wikipedia[c] is a free content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history,[3][4] and is consistently ranked among the ten most visited websites; as of August 2024[update], it was ranked fourth by Semrush,[5] and seventh by Similarweb.[6] Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[7]
Initially only available in English, editions of Wikipedia in more than 300 other languages have been developed. The English Wikipedia, with its over 6.9 million articles, is the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 63 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024[update].[W 1] In July 2024, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic was from the United States, followed by Japan at 6.2%, the United Kingdom at 5.8%, Russia at 5.2%, Germany at 5%, and the remaining 51% split among other countries.[8]
Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, and culture. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[9][10] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward[3][11][12] while becoming an important fact-checking site.[13][14] Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]
Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[19] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[20] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[W 2] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[22][W 3] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[W 4] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.[W 5]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001[20] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[W 6] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[22] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[23][24] Its integral policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[W 7] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[22] Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.[25]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[W 8][W 9] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[26]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[W 10] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[27][W 11]
After an early period of exponential growth,[28] the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[29] The edition reached 3 million articles in August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[W 12] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to ""increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits"".[28] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[30][31][32]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[33][34] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[35] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.[36] Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".[37] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, ""The Decline of Wikipedia"", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[38] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[39] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.""[40] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[41][42]
In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks.[43] With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).[43] This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.[44] In 2014, it received 8 billion page views every month.[W 13] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ""according to the ratings firm comScore"".[45] As of March 2023[update], it ranked 6th in popularity, according to Similarweb.[46] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".[47][48]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.[49] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.[50][W 14]
In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia;[51] in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument;[52] and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.[53] In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.[54][55] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.[56]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it ""had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.""[57] Varma added, ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.""[57] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].""[57] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[58] As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[59] from which cloud computing was the most cited page.[60]
On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called ""Vector 2022"".[61][62] It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.[62][W 15] The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.[61][63]
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.[64]
Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[W 16] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.[W 17][65] A frequently vandalized article can be ""semi-protected"" or ""extended confirmed protected"", meaning that only ""autoconfirmed"" or ""extended confirmed"" editors can modify it.[W 17] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes.[W 18] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as ""perhaps the most important"" means at its disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".[66]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[W 19] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.[67] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[68] However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversity the editing community.[69]
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.[e][70] On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.[W 20] ""New pages patrol"" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[W 21]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".[71]
Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.[72] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.[W 22]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.[73][74] However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.[75]
In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[75] It remained uncorrected for four months.[75] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[76][77] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".[75] The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[78]
Wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".[W 23][79] It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,[80] and criticized as creating a competitive[81] and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles.[82][83] Research has focused on, for example, impoliteness of disputes,[84][85] the influence of rival editing camps,[86][87] the conversational structure,[88] and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources.[89][90]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.[91][92] Yasseri contended that simple reverts or ""undo"" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on ""mutually reverting edit pairs"", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism, and Muhammad.[92] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[92] In 2020, researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia.[93]
Editors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia, with roughly 500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies.[94]
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.[W 24][W 25] By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.[W 26][W 27] In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the ""official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation"".[W 28]
The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the ""Five pillars"", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.[W 29] The five pillars are:
The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.[95] Editors can enforce the rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.[W 30] Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[W 19]
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[W 31] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.[W 32] Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[W 33] It must not present original research.[W 34] A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.[W 31] Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[W 35] This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.[96] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[W 36] As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.[97]
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[98][99] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[W 37]
Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for ""adminship"",[100] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[W 38] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[W 38]
By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.[101] In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.[102]
Wikipedia has delegated some administrative functions to bots, such as when granting privileges to human editors. Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors.[97]
Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".[W 23]
Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field.[103] Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers.[103]: 62  A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.[103]: 83 
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.[104] Statistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[105] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.[104]
Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).[f] Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).[104] Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.[W 39] When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.[104]
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated ""talk"" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.[108] Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".[W 40]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[109] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?"" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[110] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".[111] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.""[112] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[113]
The English Wikipedia has 6,905,069 articles, 48,204,582 registered editors, and 120,034 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.[W 41] Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".[114] Editors who do not log in are in some sense ""second-class citizens"" on Wikipedia,[114] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[115] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.[115]
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".[116] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.""[111] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".[111]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[117] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[118] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".[119]
Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[120] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[121] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[121] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".[122] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[123]
Distribution of the 63,891,853 articles in different language editions (as of November 2, 2024)[W 42]
There are currently 339 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of November 2024, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, German, French, Swedish, and Dutch Wikipedias.[W 43] The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013[update] had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Waray, Arabic, and Portuguese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Indonesian, Serbian, Korean, Norwegian, and Turkish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.[W 44][W 43] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.9 million articles. As of January 2021,[update] the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.[W 45]
Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[W 46] or points of view.[W 47]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.[W 48][125]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".[W 49] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[W 50] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[W 51] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[W 52] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[W 52] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[W 32]
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer ""interwiki links"", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.[127][W 53]
A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English Wikipedia.[126]
On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled ""The Future of Wikipedia"", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that ""the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.""[128] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.[128]
In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[128]
Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.[update][129][103] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of ""truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods"".[130] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's ""undue-weight policy"", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[131][132][133]
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an ""ax to grind"" on the topic.[130][134] A 2008 article in Education Next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.[135] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that ""Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.""[136]
Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much ""leftist bias"".[137] Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a ""propaganda"" for the left-leaning ""establishment"" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.[138] In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.[139] Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a ""western cultural bias"" (or ""pro-western bias"")[140] or ""Eurocentric bias"",[141] reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, ""similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography"". Carwil Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship [142] and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a ""decolonization"" of Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors.[143]
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[144] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that ""the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.""[145] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects ""a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors"" in science articles, ""Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.""[146]
Others raised similar critiques.[147] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,[148][149] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.[150] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a ""flawed study design"" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study ""statistical power"" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).[151]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia ""makes no guarantee of validity"" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[W 54] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information,[152] vandalism, and similar problems. Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a ""general source"" that ""can be a real boon"" in ""coming up to speed in the law governing a situation"" and, ""while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources"".[153]
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia."" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[154] Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, ""the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created"".[155] In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that: ""There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is]."" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopædia Britannica, summarizing that ""...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.""[156]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[157] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[158] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[159] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of ""fake news"" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[160]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.[70][W 55] In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[162] The article stated that: ""Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'""[162][163][164][165][166] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[167]
Some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[168] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[169][170] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[171] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. ""For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia"", he said.[172][173]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[174] In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything"".[175]
A 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education ""flipped classroom"", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.[176]
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled ""Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia"", stated that ""Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.""[177] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.[177] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled ""Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?"", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: ""Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.""[178] Beck added that: ""Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.""[178]
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[W 56] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[179][180] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[W 57] The ""Wikipedia is not censored"" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.[181] The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[182] and Pakistan,[183] among other countries.[184][185][186]
Through its ""Wikipedia Loves Libraries"" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[187] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the ""people and arts"" category, while males focus more on ""geography and science"".[188]
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.[189] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.[190]
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.[191] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.[123]
Academic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the ""average Wikipedian"", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15–49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[192] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[193][194] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[195][196] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[193]
Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.[195] In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example ""biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare"".[37] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[38]
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.[197] Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.[W 58] The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.[W 59]
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a ""blacklist"" it supplies to British internet service providers.[198]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[199][200] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted ""obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children"", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[201] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[201] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[202]
Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[203] saying that Wikipedia did not have ""material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.""[203] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".[204] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[205]
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a ""private citizen"" rather than a ""public figure"" in the eyes of the law.[206][g] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, ""we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement"", and states that ""personal information"" may be shared ""For legal reasons"", ""To Protect You, Ourselves & Others"", or ""To Understand & Experiment"".[W 60]
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka ""Tron"", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.[207]
Wikipedia has a "" Volunteer Response Team"" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS[W 61] to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.[W 62]
In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.[208]
Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.[209][210] The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.[211] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[212]
In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media.[W 63][213] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics ""for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics"", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[213][214] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard Mourou.[213] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that ""it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.""[215] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[215]
A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. ""Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.""[216]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.[W 64] The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[217][W 65] The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.[W 66]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[W 67] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, ""Information, like air, wants to be free.""[218][219] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who ""said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities"", Walsh said.[218]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the ""superprotection"" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,[W 68] Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[W 69] Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: ""It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.""[122]
Maher served as executive director until April 2021.[220] Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.[221]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.[W 70]
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.[W 71] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.[W 72] MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.[W 71][W 73] Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.[W 74] Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[W 75] In April 2005, a Lucene extension[W 76][W 77] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch.[W 78] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[222][223][224] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as ""slow and buggy"".[225] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[W 79]
Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[W 80][226][227] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[228] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[W 81] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[226] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[229] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[W 82] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[230]
As of 2021,[update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server.[W 83] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.[W 83] The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.[231]
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system.[W 84] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.[W 85][232] In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[W 86] In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France.[W 87] As of February 2023,[update] caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore, and Marseille.[W 25][W 88]
Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[38] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[233] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the ""Thank"" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[38][225] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[234] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,[W 89] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[234] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,[W 90] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[234]
Multiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.[235][236] The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects.[W 91]
The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.[237][238] Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said ""By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.""[239]
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[W 24] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.[240] In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[W 92] Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.[W 93] In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[W 94][W 95][W 96][W 97]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine,[W 98] while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.[W 99] Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[241] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.[242][243]
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.[W 100] The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.
Thousands of ""mirror sites"" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com.[244][245] Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.[W 101] Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset)[246] and DuckDuckGo.
Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.[W 102] The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,[W 103] the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,[W 104] and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.[W 105] Additionally, ""Wikipedia for Schools"", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.[W 106]
There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[247][W 107] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.[248]
The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.[249] Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF.[W 108] As of February 2023,[update] it has over 101 million items.[W 109] WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.[W 110]
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[W 111] Wikipedia publishes ""dumps"" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,[update] there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[W 112] Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this.[250]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[251]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, ""Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."" In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned ""a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile"", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the ""worry"" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[45] By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.[7]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.[W 101] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices.[W 113] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.[252][253]
The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[W 114][W 115] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[W 116] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[W 117][254] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[W 117]
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[255][256] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[255] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[38] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[255][256]
Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015.[16][257][258] This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.[259]
In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[13][14] Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, ""YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.""[14][260]
In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating ""With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.""[45] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[261] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[262]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[W 118] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[263] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[W 119] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[264] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[265]
According to ""Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011"", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[W 120] As of February 2023,[update] Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.[W 1]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[266][267][268][269] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, ""Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.""[267] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.[270] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.[update][271][272]
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[W 121][273][274] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the ""related links"" section of its ""further reading"" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[275] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[276]—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[277] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[278] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[279] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[280][281] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[282][283][284][285]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[286] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: ""Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.""[287] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled ""Wikipedia page the latest status symbol"", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[288]
One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, ""the seventh most consulted website"", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[289]
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia ""the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth"".[290][291]
In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as ""one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web"" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having ""since colonized the web for television's values"". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers ""endangered"" due to the ""gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment"". Rather than ""sapere aude"" (lit. 'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of ""dare not to care to know"". This is while Wikipedia faces ""a more concerning problem"" than funding, namely ""a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website"". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to ""save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.""[292]
Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[W 122] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the ""community"" category.[293]
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question ""Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?""[294]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.[295]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[296] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.[297] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.[298]
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning ""together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on"".[167] Another example can be found in ""Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence"", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[299] as well as the 2010 The Onion article ""'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today"".[300]
In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[301] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[302]
""My Number One Doctor"", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.[303]
In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named ""Professor Wikipedia"", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[304] The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying ""Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.""[305] In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[306] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[307]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: ""Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?""[308] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.[309]
In June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title ""Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday"" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level.[310]
Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[W 123] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,[311] Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,[W 124] Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,[W 125] Wikinews, for collaborative journalism,[W 126] and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[W 127] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing.[312] In 2012, Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide,[313] and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.[W 128]
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[314][315][316] Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay ""The amorality of Web 2.0"" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because ""free trumps quality all the time"". Carr wrote, ""Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.""[317] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the ""wisdom of crowds"" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.[318]
Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping ""far more sharply"".[319] Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, ""The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?""[319]
Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing.[320][321] In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called ""wikification"",[322] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.[323] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find ""missing"" links in Wikipedia.[324]
In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[325][326][327] They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms ""followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)"".[327][328] The study was updated in 2019.[329]
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia ""at least a dozen times a day"", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as ""a work of reference as useful as any in existence"", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[330]
A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[331][332] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence[291] to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism[333][334] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.[335][336]
In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.[337]
Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[338]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[339] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[W 129] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[340]
Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium.[341][342] The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[343][344]

There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry ""censorship"", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.)

Paragraphs:
On Wikipedia, trusted users may be appointed as administrators (also referred to as admins, sysops or janitors),[1]: 327  following a successful request for adminship. Currently, there are 847 administrators on the English Wikipedia.[2] Administrators have additional technical privileges compared with other editors, such as being able to protect and delete pages and being able to block users from editing pages.
On Wikipedia, becoming an administrator is often referred to as ""being given [or taking up] the mop"",[3] a term which has also been used elsewhere.[4] In 2006, The New York Times reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were ""geographically diverse"".[5] In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was ""running out of administrators"", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed administrators each month, but in the first half of 2012, only nine in total were appointed.[6][7]
However, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder, denied that this was a crisis or that Wikipedia was running out of admins, saying, ""The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on.""[8] Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is ""not a big deal"", and that ""It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.""[9]
In his 2008 book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual, John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role.[10] Instead, he says, admins usually ""delete pages"" and ""protect pages involved in edit wars"".[10] Wikipedia administrators are not employees or agents of the Wikimedia Foundation.[11]
While the first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales in October 2001,[12] administrator privileges on Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA).[1] Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be ""akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court"" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, ""It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point"", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was ""prove you weren't a bozo"".[6]
Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after ""extensive work on the wiki"".[1] While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision that can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a ""request"" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators.[13] This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et al. quoted that ""Prior to mid-2005, RfAs typically did not attract much attention. Since then, it has become quite common for RfAs to attract huge numbers of RfA groupies who all support one another"",[14] with the record number of votes in one RfA as of May 2022 being 468 for the RfA of longtime editor Tamzin Hadasa Kelly, which was supported by 340 users and opposed by 116 amidst controversy over their criticism of supporters of Donald Trump.[15]
Once granted administrator privileges, a user has access to additional functions in order to perform certain duties.[6] These include ""messy cleanup work"",[1] deletion of articles deemed unsuitable, protecting pages (restricting editing privileges to that page),[16]: 66  and blocking the accounts of disruptive users.[1][6] Blocking a user must be done according to Wikipedia's policies and a reason must be stated for the block, which will be permanently logged by the software.[1]: 401 [16]: 120  Use of this privilege to ""gain editing advantages"" is considered inappropriate.[1]
A 2013 scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors.[17] This corresponds to a modality of plural voting. Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007, with the goal of determining which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's Guide to requests for adminship[18] were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin.[4] In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw, which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. They found that they could ""classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates.""[19]

Harris and Trump Battle to the Wire in Swing States, Times/Siena Polls Find
Donald Trump has improved his standing in Pennsylvania even as late-deciding voters appear to be breaking for Kamala Harris.

Some Surprises in Last Battleground Polls, but Still Pointing to Deadlock
The race remains essentially even across the seven states likeliest to decide the presidency.

A Deeper Look at the Numbers
Ruth Igielnik
The gender gap continues to be massive this election. Harris is winning women by 16 percentage points in battleground states while Trump wins men by the same margin. For the first time, abortion is the most important issue for women in deciding their vote. For men, the economy is the top concern.
Ruth Igielnik
Harris is winning young voters by 17 percentage points in battleground states. That is a substantial improvement over Joe Biden’s standing with young voters earlier this year. But Harris still slightly lags Biden’s 2020 numbers with young voters, many of whom are struggling to decide up until the end.
Lisa Lerer
There are still voters to be persuaded, even at this late hour in the race. The poll shows that 11 percent of voters remained undecided, down from 16 percent about a month ago.
Ruth Igielnik
The poll finds that in some states nearly half of voters have already voted. Harris is winning those voters in six of the seven states, while Trump is winning them in Arizona.
Ruth Igielnik
All eyes are on Pennsylvania, where Trump and Harris are deadlocked. The last three Times/Siena polls had Harris +4 in the state, suggesting the race has narrowed significantly in the state that might be key to victory for either candidate.
Maya King
Harris has a slight edge over Trump in Georgia. Her campaign has invested millions in the state in the hopes of building on Biden’s narrow 2020 win in the state. Harris rallied thousands near downtown Atlanta yesterday.
Katie Glueck
Harris and Trump are deadlocked in Michigan, a crucial battleground state that Biden won in 2020 and Trump won in 2016. Harris is campaigning in Michigan today, while Trump has a rally scheduled in Grand Rapids tomorrow night.
Jennifer Medina
Harris is narrowly ahead of Trump in Nevada. Democrats have been anxiously analyzing early voting patterns in the state and are now relying on a heavy turnout in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the majority of the state’s Democrats.
Jonathan Swan
The final batch of public polls has set off a round of late second-guessing among some Trump allies. But Trump’s core team remains convinced that these public polls are underestimating his support and that he is on track to win.

Paragraphs:
Fake news refers to false or misleading information which masquerades as legitimate news. Generally, fake news falls into two categories:
Misinformation isn’t a new phenomenon – the term “fake news” was actually used in the 19th century – but the internet and soI don’cial media have transformed how it’s created and spread. Pre-internet, people tended to receive their news from trusted media sources whose journalists were required to follow strict codes of practice. The internet enabled new ways to publish, share and consume news and information, with relatively little regulation or editorial standards. Many people now consume news from social media and other online sources – but it’s not always easy to determine which stories are credible and which are false.
There are different types of fake news, depending on the motivation of those who create it. For example:
Sensationalism sells, and outrageous or weird stories and distorted images drive clicks and shares online. Clickbait refers to stories deliberately designed to get more website visitors and increase advertising revenue for the website owners – often at the expense of truth and accuracy.
This refers to false or distorted stories written to mislead audiences and promote a political agenda or biased perspective.
Sometimes, journalists don’t have time to check all their facts before publishing, leading to genuine mistakes becoming fake news. However, trusted new sources will correct errors in their stories and be transparent with readers when they’ve got things wrong.
Sometimes a story may be broadly true, but a sensationalist or misleading headline is used to entice readers to click on it. This can lead to fake news – since usually only the headline and small snippets of the article are displayed on social media, where it can quickly spread.
This is when genuine news sources are impersonated with false, made-up stories to deceive or mislead audiences.
Some fake news is published for entertainment value. For example, satirical stories use humor, irony, or exaggeration to joke about the news or famous people. These stories don't attempt to mislead audiences because they aren't meant to be taken seriously. Notable examples of satirical websites include The Onion and The Daily Mash.
High-profile politicians have been known to dismiss stories they disagree with – which may be factual and verified – as “fake news”. Because the term “fake news” is expansive and means different things to different people, it can be contested. In 2018, the British Government banned the term from official papers or documents, claiming it was too poorly defined to be meaningful. Instead, it prefers to use the terms ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation"" when describing false stories:
Fake news is often spread through fake news websites, which, in an attempt to gain credibility, often emulate authentic news sources. According to research, social media enables false claims to spread quickly – more quickly, in fact, than real news. Fake news spreads rapidly because it’s typically designed to grab attention and appeal to emotions – which is why it often features outlandish claims or stories which provoke anger or fear.
Social media feeds often prioritize content based on engagement metrics – that is, how often it’s shared and liked – rather than how accurate or well-researched it is. This approach can allow clickbait, hyperbole, and misinformation to spread widely. Social media companies are seen as platforms rather than publishers, which means they don’t have the same legal liabilities as traditional media outlets – although this may change as the political and legal landscape evolves.
Social media bots can spread fake news since they mass produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of their sources. Bots can create fake accounts online, which then gain followers, recognition, and authority – some of which are programmed to spread misinformation.
Trolls – internet users who deliberately try to start arguments or upset people – also play a part in spreading fake news. Sometimes they can be paid to do so for political reasons. The terms “troll farm” or “troll factory” are sometimes used in this context to refer to institutionalized groups of trolls who attempt to interfere in political decision-making.
Fake news sometimes involves the use of Deepfakes. These are fake videos created using digital software, machine learning, and face-swapping. Images are combined to create new footage which shows events or actions that never actually took place. The results can be very convincing and difficult to identify as false.
Coronavirus fake news
The Covid-19 pandemic provided fertile ground for false information online, with numerous examples of fake news throughout the crisis. A persistent example of fake news in social media was the claim that 5G technology was linked to the spread of the virus – supposedly because 5G suppressed the immune system while the virus communicated through radio waves. These claims were not true and were repeatedly debunked by official sources but were still shared extensively.
US presidential election in 2016
Fake news and misinformation became a big issue during the US election in 2016, with false and misleading claims across the political spectrum. One analysis suggested that a large proportion of fake news generated in the election was created by teenagers in Macedonia, who found the more hyper-partisan stories they created, the more people clicked through and shared, and the more money they made as a result.
Boston Marathon bombing
In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, false claims that the bombing was an elaborate ruse plotted by the US government circulated online. In the wake of many terrorist events across the world, conspiracy theories are often rife. The notion that they are ""false flag"" operations – i.e., carried out by the state or a secret cabal to pin the blame on others or provide cover for other activities – is a common trope.
Kim Jong-un – the sexiest man alive?
In 2012, satirical website The Onion ran an article claiming that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un had been voted the sexiest man alive, declaring that ""the Pyongyang-bred heartthrob is every woman's dream come true."" In an example of how satire can sometimes be misunderstood across cultures, publications in China – including the online version of China's Communist Party newspaper – reported the claim as though it were true.
People often make important decisions – for example, how to vote in an election or what medical treatment to follow when they’re ill – based on what they read in the news. That’s why trusted news is so important. The dangers of fake news include:
You may be wondering how to identify fake news on Facebook and other social media sites? As a student, how to avoid fake news? Or how to avoid accidentally sharing misinformation online? Here are ten tips to identify misinformation, recognize fake news websites, and think before you share:
1. Check the source:
Check the web address for the page you're looking at. Sometimes, fake news sites may have spelling errors in the URL or use less conventional domain extensions such as "".infonet"" or "".offer"". If you are unfamiliar with the site, look in the About Us section.
2. Check the author:
Research them to see if they are credible – for example, are they real, do they have a good reputation, are they writing about their specific area of expertise, and do they have a particular agenda? Consider what the writer’s motivation might be.
3. Check other sources:
Are other reputable news or media outlets reporting on the story? Are credible sources cited within the story? Professional global news agencies have editorial guidelines and extensive resources for fact-checking, so if they are also reporting the story, that’s a good sign.
4. Maintain a critical mindset:
A lot of fake news is cleverly written to provoke strong emotional reactions such as fear or anger. Maintain a critical mindset by asking yourself – why has this story been written? Is it promoting a particular cause or agenda? Is it trying to make me click through to another website?
5. Check the facts:
Credible news stories will include plenty of facts – data, statistics, quotes from experts, and so on. If these are missing, question why. Reports with false information often contain incorrect dates or altered timelines, so it’s a good idea to check when the article was published. Is it a current or old news story?
6. Check the comments:
Even if the article or video is legitimate, the comments below may not be. Often links or comments posted in response to content can be autogenerated by bots or people hired to put our misleading or confusing information.
7. Check your own biases:
We all have biases – could these be influencing the way you respond to the article? Social media can create echo chambers by suggesting stories that match your existing browsing habits, interests, and opinions. The more we read from diverse sources and perspectives, the more likely it is that we can draw accurate conclusions.
8. Check whether it’s a joke:
Satirical websites are popular, and sometimes it is not always clear whether a story is just a joke or parody. Check the website to see if it’s known for satire or creating funny stories.
9. Check images are authentic:
Images you see on social media could have been edited or manipulated. Possible signs include warping – where straight lines in the background now appear wavy – as well as strange shadows, jagged edges, or skin tone that looks too perfect. Bear in mind, too, that an image may be accurate but simply used in a misleading context. You can use tools such as Google’s Reverse Image Search to check where an image originates from and whether it has been altered.
10. Use a fact-checking site:
Some of the best known include:
Fake news relies on believers reposting, retweeting, or otherwise sharing false information. If you're not sure whether an article is authentic or not, pause and think before you share. To help stay safe online, use an antivirus solution like Kaspersky Total Security, which protects you from hackers, viruses, malware, and other online threats.

Deliberately inaccurate stories – that is, the people publishing them know them to be false but publish them anyway. This might be to manipulate public opinion or to drive traffic to a specific website.
Stories that contain elements of truth but are broadly inaccurate. This might be because the writer hasn’t checked all their facts or has exaggerated certain aspects to make a particular point.
Disinformation– fake or misleading stories created and shared deliberately, often by a writer who might have a financial or political motive to do so.
Misinformation – this also means fake or misleading stories, but in this case, the stories may not have been deliberately created or shared with the intention to mislead.
When people can’t distinguish between real and fake news, it creates confusion and misunderstanding about important social and political issues. When people have a generalized sense of ""you can't believe anything you read,"" it undermines overall trust in legitimate news sources.
Fake and misleading stories relating to medical treatments or major diseases – such as cancer or Covid-19 – could lead to individuals making misinformed decisions about their health.
A lot of fake news is designed to stir up and intensify social conflict. When different sides of an argument have their own ‘facts’, it leads to greater polarization within societies and can affect electoral outcomes.
Universities and colleges expect students to use quality sources of information for assignments. Students who use sources with false or misleading information could receive lower grades.

Every artist needs an artboard, brush, palette, paint, and a vision to create the beautiful art we all love.
…or, in some cases, have no choice but to love.

Like artists, designers also require specific tools to create engaging design systems people can interact with.
One that you’ve probably heard of is Figma – a cloud-based design tool.
Let’s cut to the chase!
To get started on Figma, you need to have an account. So, let’s open one together.
First, go to www.figma.com and click the Get Started button at the top right corner to sign up. If you have an account with them already, click the Log in button instead.

Since this is a tutorial, we’ll go with the sign-up option. For that, Figma gives you two choices.

Click the Continue with Google button or enter your email and preferred password. You’ll also be asked to input your name, specify the kind of work you do, and how you intend to use Figma.
Then, click the Create account button. You’ll be sent a verification email almost immediately. Open the message and tap Verify email, and you’re all set.
Now, you should have access to a dashboard that looks like this:

Creating new projects
To create projects in Figma, you must be part of a team. If you already are, just join them and open their file browser. But if you don’t, click the Create new team button on the left side of the page and enter a team name. Then invite collaborators you’d like to work with you on the project.

After you’ve created a team, you’ll be taken to the team’s page. From there, you can create a new project.
So let’s do that!
Click on the New project button on the top right side of your team’s file page. Enter a name for the project if you’re on Figma’s Pro plan or select the Team project box to proceed if you’re on the free plan.

Voila! You’ve created a new project.
You can only create one project and three designs with the Free plan. But with the Pro plan, you can access unlimited projects and designs.
Adding a design file
Design files house the design you want to work on, and they can be added to the project’s environment.

Just tap the New design file button, and you’ll be redirected to a new page that shows the Figma file like this. 👇

You can give your design file a name when you first create it. The default name is ‘Untitled,’ but you can tap on it to change it, so it’s more descriptive.
Explore Figma templates
Figma has a database of templates you can customize for your UX designs. To access them, head back to the project folder and select See all. It’s just under the New Design button you clicked on earlier.

Now that your Figma account is set up let’s start creating new frames for your design.
Frames are like boards on Figma. They represent the interface end users of the design will interact with. You can select different frames on Figma in which to place your design.
To create new frames, open the design file and click the Frame tool in the top left-hand corner. Having trouble finding it? Look for the button that looks like a hashtag. You can also create new frames by pressing the letter F on your keyboard.

Choosing a frame size
Once you’ve selected the frame tool, go to the left side of the page. Pick a frame from the selections available, and it’ll appear on the canvas. Available frame sizes include most iPhones and Androids.
For this tutorial, let’s select the Surface Pro 8 frame:

If you need a frame different from the ones available, you can draw your own by clicking and dragging the mouse.
Editing a frame’s properties
After selecting a frame, you’ll see a panel under Design on the right side of the page. There you can assign different properties to the frame as you see fit.
For example, you can change the frame size by typing in your desired pixel size in the X, Y, W, and H columns.
Other things you can do include filling the frame with color using Fill, adding effects by clicking Effects, and more.
Using layers
On the left side of the screen is the Layers panel. Each time you add a new element or frame, a new layer is added. You can rearrange them by dragging and dropping them.
You can also group layers to have a more organized file if you want to move them across different frames. To group layers, select all the elements. Press Ctrl+G if you’re a Windows user or CMD+G on a Mac.
Vector shapes
If you want to use basic shapes (rectangle, circle, etc.), pick the square sign from the top of the page.
For more complex shapes, icons, logos, or buttons, select the pen icon from the top menu or press P on your keyboard.

With it, you can click anywhere on the frame to create the kind of shape you have in mind. Then, press Enter when you’re done.
If you want to modify the vector shape when designing, you can do so via the Properties menu on the right-hand side of the page.
What’s a design without pictures? Here’s how you add them on Figma!
There are different ways to insert images into your frame on Figma. The most popular and simplest way is to drag and drop them into your work area.
You can also click the Shape menu at the top of the page and select Place image/video.

When you click Open, a dialogue box will open, where you can select the images you want to use. Then, click OK to insert the pictures.
Alternatively, press CMD+Shift+K or Ctrl+Shift+K, to open the dialogue box.
If the image you want to use is from another place on Figma, select the image and press CMD+C or Ctrl+C. Head over to the frame you want to use and press CMD+V or Ctrl+V.
But what if you want to insert the image into a different shape or frame?
To do that, click on the frame. Select Fill from the Properties menu on the right side of the work area if you want to add color.
You’ll see a drop-down menu at the top-left of the color wheel: click it and select Image or Videos.

To choose an image, hover your cursor on the smaller window with black and white colors and click Choose Image.

A dialogue box will pop up so you can pick the images you want. Click Open to insert them into the shape or frame.
If you want, you can edit the picture with the different parameters shown in the small window.
To insert objects, click the square shape icon from the top menu to draw polygons, stars, arrows, lines, rectangles, and ellipses.

Select any shape, click on the frame, and drag it to your preferred size. For a shape with equal proportions, press down the shift key while you draw.
Adding text on Figma is pretty straightforward too.
Just click the T sign and tap on where you want the text on the frame to draw a text box. Then, start typing.
To edit the text, click the text layer and double-click on the text to edit. You can also edit it from the Properties menu. There, you’ll be able to change the text’s color, font, and even edit the words in the content section.
Now, if you’re working on multiple design projects using Figma, wouldn’t it be great to have saved styles that you could simply add to each project?
To learn how to save styles, keep reading!
By saving your styles, you can avoid having to redo the same design process over and over again.

For example, if you want the text headings of your design to have the same font, color, and size, you can create a style and save it as a reusable H2 style.
Then, apply that style to the corresponding headings.
Here’s how to create a text style:
To use the style, select the text you want formatted and click on the style icon to select it.
Text isn’t the only style you can save. Aside from text, you can also save colors, grids, and even effects.
As we saw earlier, saved styles can help you reuse colors or effects in future projects. To do that, you’ll need to:
You can follow the same steps when adding the text style to text whenever you need to reuse the saved templates.
There’s just one tiny drawback with saving a style; it’ll only be available on the file you’re working on.
So, what if you wanna use the styles on other project files? You’ll have to publish it to your team library. Here’s how:

That’s about it for saving styles. This should help you save time when brainstorming, wireframing, or designing.
To further simplify this process, you might want to consider adding reusable components to your design workflow.
Don’t worry, we’ll unpack what it means and how to add them in the next section.
Components are collections of UI elements, objects, or layers that you can repeatedly use across your design. They make it easy to maintain a consistent design to update or scale your work without stress.
Let’s assume you’re working on web design and want the logo and name of the brand to appear across the site.
Those are different elements that you can reuse. You could add both to a component and title it ‘brand logo.’ Then, add it to other frames.
Follow these steps when adding components:
You’ll notice that both layers will be fused into a single layer with the new name: ‘Component 1.’ You can rename it by double-clicking on the name.
This refers to the use of iterations of the components in your design that are not in the initial component.
To create a component icon, click on the Assets panel, the tab next to the Layers menu on the left side of the page.
Select and drag the component’s name to the canvas, creating an instance. You can edit the component icon, which won’t reflect on the original.

Like styles, you can save components for other files or projects.
Click anywhere on the canvas and select the down arrow beside the file’s name at the top of the page.
From the drop-down menu, click Publish library and follow the on-screen instructions to publish the component to the team library.
This feature, however, is only available to Pro or Enterprise users.
Still, in simplifying your processes, there’s another thing you can do…
Auto layout is a function that lets you create a dynamic frame that expands or contracts when you change the content inside it.
This will help you avoid having to adjust the frame repeatedly. It also lets you see whether your design works in real life with a single click.
To begin, change layers to auto layouts:

As you change the content, the box automatically resizes.
Nested auto layouts
Figma also lets you nest auto layouts, meaning you can have a frame within a frame for a more attractive user interface or UI design.
To nest auto layouts, you should have multiple elements or objects you want to merge.
Select them, press shift+A, and you’ll have a nested auto layout.
It should include a parent frame and a child frame.
And that’s about it for auto layouts!
You know how you can take a car you plan on buying for a test drive?
Well, you can do the same for your interface design. But on Figma, it’s referred to as testing prototypes, which we unpack next.
Whether you’re designing a mobile app, landing page, or website, you can test the user experience of either project on Figma’s space in real-time. Testing will help you know what needs to be improved.
To start testing, head over to the Properties menu on the right side of the page. Click the Prototype tab at the top of the panel.
The first thing you’ll likely see is the option to select the device type you want to preview the design on.
If you already selected the device you were designing for when you created the frame, you won’t see that option.

To proceed, click the + sign beside Flow starting point.
It will place a Flow 1 text at the top left corner of the first frame to indicate that as the starting point of the design flow. If you don’t want the selected frame as the first point, right-click the frame’s name and pick Delete starting point.

After selecting the starting point, you must select a hotspot from the starting frame. A hotspot is an area or element users must click to be directed to the next page.
To pick a hotspot, hover over the desired element and see a blue circle by the edge.
When your mouse is directly on the circle, a plus sign will appear. Click and drag the hotspot (+) to connect it to the next screen. It should look like this:

After making the connection, you should see an Interaction details panel.
There you can choose an interaction type for the hotspot. For instance, select On tap if you want the user to tap the hotspot to go to the next page. You can also choose an animation from the menu to show the transition between both screens.
Now, you can make more connections by selecting a hotspot on the second screen that, when users tap it, will link back to the first screen.
When you’re done, you can preview the web or app design by clicking the Play button at the top right corner of the screen.
If you’re comfortable with the final designs, there’s only one step left: invite team members or other stakeholders to collaborate.
Sharing a project with your team, aka developer handoff, is easy on Figma. Just click the Share button at the top right corner of the page.

Then, enter the email of other users or collaborators you want to share it with.
A shortcut is just to copy the link and share it with stakeholders. If you go with this option, update the security setting to Anyone with the link.
***
And with that, we’ve come to the end of this tutorial.
Whew, that was a lot! But we’re confident that you’ve gained a lot from this guide.
Just one more thing, and we can call it a day.
So far, you’ve learned how to use Figma for designs, mockups, and as a prototyping tool.
What you need, in addition to that, is a more streamlined design process that can help you get clear contextual feedback on your visuals.
While Figma allows you to add comments, you can do much more with MarkUp.io.
More specifically, you can optimize reviews, implement feedback, and keep track of the comments as you resolve them.
There’ll also be less confusion for clients who probably won’t get the hang of the design tool you’re using. Feel free to claim a free 30-day trial with MarkUp.io to see for yourself.

Im overwhelmed by the amount of resources there are out there. Some says to learn the subject other to learn tool, some both, ahh so much chores, that i decided to learn the tool but now again there are tons of resources. docs, tutorial, project. am i doing wrong my learning through project? like without understanding spacing,color etc just copying pasting or trying my own idea to do that in figma then learn lets say for that project i required to use gradient so i searched all the way to learn then back to project repeat the process till my project is done.

Am i doing wrong by learning through this method. i feel like i am wasting time by first understanding tool one by one then at last building project for example what is frame and its propetries then at the time of building i dont really remember what i watched or read
Should i switch to my old method of learning through project? whether its fancy project that i know isnt appicable in real life till making cuz its seems interesting not caring much about perfect spacing and guidelines for now, what do you think?

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that’s taken the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch or Adobe Illustrator, which are standalone applications, Figma can be run entirely from a web browser and, therefore, works not only on Macs but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. It's also free to use!
Another big advantage of Figma is that it allows real-time collaboration on the same file. When using conventional “offline” apps like Sketch and Illustrator, if designers want to share their work, they typically have to export it to an image file and then send it via email or instant message.
In Figma, instead of exporting static images, we can simply share a link to the Figma file for clients and colleagues to open in their browsers. This in itself saves significant time and can streamline a designer’s workflow. But more importantly, it means that clients and colleagues can interact more richly with the work and review the latest version of the file.
This course aims to introduce all of the key functions in Figma. We’ll achieve that by building a set of app screens together. We’ll also use Figma’s prototyping functionality to link the screens together, meaning you can experience how the screens will behave like they would if this were a functional app ready for people to download and use. You’ll be able to share your prototypes with friends, or develop your design further and add it to your portfolio!
Before we get started with today’s lesson, take a sec to work through our quick one-minute goal setting exercise. We want to make sure you’re getting the most out of this course... and that by the end of it you’ve mastered the basics of Figma and accomplished any personal learning goals!
Time to complete: 30 minutes
Getting started in Figma is as simple as going to www.figma.com, clicking “Get started”, entering your details, and completing a quick verification activity. Once you’ve done that, Figma will guide you to a screen with a few more onboarding questions before throwing you right into a project file with some examples of what you can create using Figma .
The look and feel of the Figma interface is quite minimal, but it belies a set of powerful features. Here’s an explanation of the interface’s main areas (labeled above):
Unlike regular desktop design apps, Figma’s menu can be found by clicking the Figma logo in the top-left of the screen. Take a minute to browse around this dropdown and see what’s there! Here, you can also search for specific commands you need. Click on the magnifying glass where it says “Quick actions…” and type in “rectangle” and you’ll quickly find the Rectangle Tool, complete with a handy reminder of its keyboard shortcut (it’s [[R]], by the way).
Here you can quickly access the tools you’re likely to use most often: move, frame, shapes, pen, text, etc. (We’ll cover these tools in the next couple of days!)
This area shows extra options for whatever object you have selected on your canvas. When no object is selected (as shown above), Figma displays the file name.
The right side of the toolbar is where you can find the file sharing functions and see who else is viewing your file in real-time. You’ll also find view and zoom options.
Also known simply as the “left sidebar,” this is where every element in the file is listed and organized into Pages, Frames and Groups.
‍This is where you’ll create all of your designs!
The properties panel offers contextual information and settings for whatever object is selected. In the image above, we’re seeing options for the Canvas itself. By default, you’re viewing the Design tab, but there is also a separate tab for setting up a Prototype —we’ll cover this later in the week.
Now that you’ve found your way around, let’s start making stuff! Let’s start a new project by clicking the Menu button (Figma’s logo) in the top left corner and then selecting File and “New design file.” Doing this should automatically create a new file with an empty canvas in a new tab on your browser.
In Figma, a Frame is essentially a container for other elements. If you’ve used Sketch or Adobe Illustrator before, it functions in the same way as an Artboard. Press [[F]] to select the Frame Tool. Alternatively, you can click the Frame tool icon in the toolbar at the top of the window. Equally, if you’re used to Sketch, you can also hit [[A]] (for “Artboard”).
Note that we’ll often refer to keyboard shortcuts in these tutorials. It’s worth getting in the habit of using these shortcuts because they’ll significantly speed up your workflow further down the line. In the short videos through this course, you’ll see the keystrokes we use on Mac computers.
There are a couple of ways of creating a Frame. We can either click and drag in the canvas area, or we can select a pre-set Frame size from the Properties panel on the right hand side of the window. We chose the iPhone SE template. Try both ways now!
You’ll probably find yourself wanting to zoom in and out quite a bit in Figma, particularly once we start working with multiple Frames. The standard zoom commands are accessed with [[⌘]][[+]] and [[⌘]][[-]]. Try it now!
Those commands will just focus in on the center of your current view. But there are some other handy zoom commands available:
Select the Frame by clicking on its name, then try alternating these commands to switch between the selection and the whole canvas.
Finally, here’s an *extra* handy zoom tip to move between Frames without having to zoom in and out the whole time:
Another useful tool, particularly when you’re zoomed in close or working on a large file, is the Hand tool. Try pressing and holding the [[Spacebar]] on your keyboard and you’ll see a hand icon pop up. Click and drag to move the whole canvas around. If you’re working with a Mac trackpad, you can do the same by dragging on the trackpad with two fingers.
Next, let’s create some text. Press [[T]] to select the Text tool, and click anywhere within your iPhone SE frame to create a Text layer. This is going to be part of a button design, so let’s type “Sign In”. Hit [[Escape]] to exit the Text tool.
Press [[R]] to select the Rectangle tool. Drag a button-shaped rectangle around the text you just created.
Currently, the text is hidden underneath the rectangle. To fix this, we need to use Figma’s “Arrange” commands. Head over to the Layers panel on the left of the window. Select the “Sign In” text layer, then right-click (PC/Mac) or ctrl-click (Mac) to bring up a list of options. Click “Bring to front”, and the text will now be placed on top of the rectangle.
You can also access Arrange tools using keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
PC:
This being a button, we want the text and rectangle shapes to be centered relative to one another. Figma has a set of “Align” commands that allow us to do this. Make sure that the Move tool is selected by pressing [[Escape]], or [[V]], and then drag a “marquee” (a rectangular selection) around the text and the rectangle.
We can access the Align commands in the Properties (the interface area to the right of the window). Click “Align Horizontal Centers” and “Align Vertical Centers” to get the two objects nicely lined up.
Select the rectangle shape you just created. In the Properties panel, there is a setting called “Corner Radius”, which allows us to make the corners of any shape rounded. Here, type in the number of pixels you want each corner to be rounded by.
To max out the corners and create semi-circles at each end of the rectangle, just enter a number larger than half the object height. (We set ours to 32 so that we’re covered in case we want to make the button a bit bigger later on—but try out some different numbers and see what happens!)
The color settings can also be found in the Properties panel. We often want to attract people’s attention with buttons—so select the rectangle, and pick a bright color! We’ve gone with a bright yellow by typing in a hex code (#EEEE33)—but you can also click to open the color palette, and pick a color that way.
With the text layer selected, you can access settings in the Properties panel to change the font, as well as font size, weight, and color. We’ve stuck with Inter, but switched up to bold and uppercase text. We also aligned the text to center. Try exploring the options!
That brings us to the end of Day 1 of Figma 101! We’ve found our way around the interface, tried out a few basic tools, and created a button that we’ll be able to use in our app.
The final thing to do for today is to give our file a name—to do this, just deselect all objects ([[Escape]] will do the trick), and click where it says “Untitled” at the top of the window. Then type something like “Figma 101 App”. That’s it! Figma stores all your files in the cloud.
See you again tomorrow, when we’ll be creating our first app screen.
Create a login screen for your app.

UPDATED Nov. 3, 2024, at 8:36 AM

We adjust polls for house effects, mode, partisanship, voter likelihood and third parties and weight them based on their firm’s 538 pollster rating and how often it polls.
LAST UPDATED Nov. 1
Now that we are in the closing days of the 2024 presidential race, pollsters have started releasing their final readings of the campaign. They have mostly been a mixed bag. On Friday, Marist College released their highly-anticipated final polls across the Midwestern states, finding Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump by 3 points in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and 2 points in Wisconsin. That would be good news for Harris if those were the only polls released this week, but they weren’t: An Echelon Insights survey found Trump up 5 points in the Keystone State, and CNN/SSRS has the former president up by 1 in Georgia. In aggregate, this has been enough to push our model modestly back in Harris’s direction. Currently, our forecast gives Trump a XXX out of 100 chance of winning the election, and gives Harris a XXX out of 100 chance.
Still, the closeness of the race bears repeating what has become something of a mantra here at 538 recently: A close race in the polls does not necessarily mean the outcome will be close. All seven swing states are still within a normal polling error of going to the candidate who is currently “losing”in each. While the polls have identified a close race, our model shows what you should expect if those polls are off.
538’s forecast is based on a combination of polls and campaign “fundamentals,” such as economic conditions, state partisanship and incumbency. It’s not meant to “call” a winner, but rather to give you a sense of how likely each candidate is to win. Check out our methodology to learn exactly how we calculate these probabilities.
—G. Elliott Morris
The forecast updates at least once a day and whenever we get new data. Uncertainty will decrease as we get closer to Election Day.
We forecast the popular vote only for candidates polling at 5 percent or higher nationally, polling at 10 percent or higher in at least one state or who are on the ballot in almost every state. Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s withdrawal, only Harris and Trump meet these criteria, so we are effectively forecasting the two-way popular vote between Democrats and Republicans.
Number of electoral votes and the probability of a Democratic or Republican win in each state. Outlined states are most likely to give the winner their 270th Electoral College vote.
Use the table below to sort states by name, forecasted margin of victory or two different metrics of how much influence they have over the outcome.
A state’s tipping-point chance is the probability it will give the Electoral College winner their 270th electoral vote. The Voter Power Index (VPI) is a relative measure of how likely an individual voter in that state is to determine the outcome of the election.

Paragraphs:

Nate CohnChief political analyst
While the overall result of our final Times/Siena polls is largely unchanged since our previous wave of battleground polls, there were some notable shifts. Surprisingly, the longstanding gap between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt battlegrounds narrowed considerably. The overall effect of these swings is somewhat contradictory — Harris’s position in the Electoral College isn’t necessarily improved. Updated Nov. 3

Both Trump and Harris have states they can probably count on to get at least 200 electoral votes, but they need to get to 270 to win. Let’s zoom in on seven key states in the middle where the vote was closest in 2020.
Harris 251
Trump 268
If the polls miss in Trump’s favor Trump could win if the polls are underestimating him even slightly. In 2016 and 2020, he outperformed the polls in the swing states, and he could do it again. Here’s one possibility.
Harris 226
Trump 312
If the polls miss in Harris’s favor Harris could easily prevail if the polls are underestimating her. For example, state polls underestimated Democrats in the 2022 midterms, and they could also miss in that direction this year. Here’s a possible scenario.
Harris 292
Trump 246
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Across the seven swing states that are likely to decide the outcome of this election, the polls are so remarkably close that neither candidate has a meaningful edge in this final stretch. But if the polls are off even by a small margin, it’s possible either candidate could sweep most or all of these states. You can explore all possible scenarios and see the potential paths to victory here. Updated Oct. 23
States are shown in order of the closest current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
We now have enough polls to generate an average in Iowa, after a new poll from the well-regarded pollster J. Ann Selzer. That poll finds Harris up three percentage points. Our average has Trump ahead by 2 percentage points, which puts it in line with the core battleground states. Updated Nov. 2
It’s normal for polls not to match the final results, sometimes by considerable amounts. The ranges in this chart represent the magnitude of each state’s biggest polling miss in recent elections, shown in relation to the current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
In 2016 and 2020, the polls underestimated Trump. But in 2012 they underestimated the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and in 2022 Democrats outperformed polling averages in several key midterm races. Past polling misses can give a sense of the magnitude by which current averages could be wrong, but they are not a guarantee of which way today’s polls may be off.
Every poll here influences the averages above. Polls from “select pollsters,” which meet certain criteria for reliability, count for more and are shown with a diamond. You can filter by state and toggle to show only select pollsters.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Polls by “select pollsters” are shown with a diamond. These pollsters have backgrounds that tend to mean they are more reliable. Also, polls that were conducted by or for partisan organizations are labeled, as they often release only results that are favorable to their cause.
Arrows to the left indicate polling gains for Harris; to the right, for Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Even as Trump has gained over the last few weeks, the battleground states remain extraordinarily tight. With the race so close, it wouldn’t take much of a polling error to yield a different outcome. The polls are never exactly right; if they err one way or another by a point or two, as usual, then either side could win by a decisive margin. Updated Oct. 31
This chart shows how the polling margin has changed over the course of the campaign, first for the Biden vs. Trump matchup, and now for Harris vs. Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Nationwide, Harris now has her smallest lead in our average since the Democratic convention. Most of the major national polls have showed a shift toward Trump since their prior surveys. The size of his gains shouldn’t be overstated — we’re talking about a point or so — but it has nonetheless been enough to make the race more or less truly tied. Whatever edge Harris might have had has vanished. Updated Oct. 23
About our polling averages
Our averages include polls collected by The New York Times and by FiveThirtyEight. The estimates adjust for a variety of factors, including the recency and sample size of a poll, whether a poll represents likely voters, and whether other polls have shifted since a poll was conducted.
We also evaluate whether each pollster: Has a track record of accuracy in recent electionsIs a member of a professional polling organizationConducts probability-based sampling
These elements factor into how much weight each poll gets in the average. And we consider pollsters that meet at least two of the three criteria to be “select pollsters,” so long as they are conducting polls for nonpartisan sponsors. Read more about our methodology.
The Times conducts its own national and state polls in partnership with Siena College. Those polls are included in the averages. Follow Times/Siena polling here.
Maine and Nebraska award two electoral votes to the statewide winner and a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. (Maine has two congressional districts, and Nebraska has three.) Historical election results for these districts are calculated based on votes cast within the current boundaries of the district.

Paragraphs:
With just two days left until Election Day, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are putting the bows on their presidential campaigns, wrapping up arguments in must-win states before their final test: Tuesday, Nov. 5.
The former president has rallies scheduled in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, while the vice president has planned multiple stops in Michigan.
Keep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage live from the campaign trail.
Donald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he ""shouldn't have left"" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
As Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd, ""we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” adding ""I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.""
Trump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.
− Marina Pitofsky
As voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.
Lichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Silver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his “gut” tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.
− Karissa Waddick
Visiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.
Vance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.
“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.

Kamala Harris followed her guest appearance on Saturday Night Live by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.
Harris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”
Americans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”
The country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5, “we are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
“Morning is on its way,” she said.
–Michael Collins
It is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.
But you can anticipate delays.
Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.
– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.
For example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris 17-point advantage among women.
Stefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”
She also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better of under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, childcare was affordable,” Stefanik said.
It was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.

Talking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.
“I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news,” right?” Trump said to laughs from the crowd.
“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.
– Karissa Waddick
The former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.
""The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,"" Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.
Trump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.
""We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,"" Trump said. ""And fake polls.""
– David Jackson
Donald Trump at rally in Lititz, Pa. on Sunday morning repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”
“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.
A judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from being able to get their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.
In Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.

Top Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.
The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.
Trump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa in pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.
It’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning females voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.

Sen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”
Fetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.
“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”
Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have made anti-trans attacks a major part of their closing message to voters in the 2024 election, arguing

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.
A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
In an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.
“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”
The Republican governor remained optimistic of his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: ""It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”
– Kathryn Palmer
Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.
""No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,"" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. ""In fact, it’s not even close!""
Even so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
A loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigns today in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.
–David Jackson
Indiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.
Actor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.
In the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”
Ford concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.
–Michael Collins
Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., appearing Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which he appeared to call Trump's supporters ""garbage.""
The president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.
""As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,"" Warnock said, adding that he believes ""That's what Kamala Harris is doing.""

Could red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?
The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.
Yet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.
– Des Moines Register staff
The 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.
It's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.
– Marina Pitofsky
Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broke the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.
Carr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a “clear and blatant effort to evade,” the commissions rule, unless NBC offered Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.
“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.
Carr, who was appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.

Works well. Recommend.
I ended up giving it away to a new up coming Chef in the making. He loves it and is happy using it.
This is a wonderful little food processor for those who are single and do not need to prepare a big meal. My daughter saw it and she said when she needs to make a smaller portion she'll come borrow it.
This is wonderful!! It's great for me, as I only cook for 1, or 2 at the most. Fast, easy, and easy clean up!!
So glad I bought this. Just the right size. Use it more then I thought I would.
Remind me about upcoming Cuisinart shows.

Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Be sure to check the food frequently to prevent overprocessing.
If you overprocess, you are likely to get a watery paste instead of a fine chop.
Use the grind function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts.
Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You may have to operate the Mini-Prep Plus Processor for several seconds with some food to achieve the desired results.
Large enough for most chopping/grinding jobs, small enough to store easily

It's never a bad time to start practicing — and reaping the benefits of! — yoga. This ancient practice offers options for all fitness levels and has become increasingly popular in the U.S., with about one in seven Americans practicing yoga, according to a 2017 national survey. While the complex inversions and more rigorous styles can be intimidating, there are many different types of yoga that can be approachable for anyone, at any age or physical ability.
""Start with a class designed for beginners,"" says Peloton Yoga and Meditation Director Ross Rayburn. He recommends beginners kick things off by practicing just once a week and building a more regular cadence from there.
Whether you plan to join a yoga studio or you want to take a virtual yoga class from home, we've compiled everything beginners need to know about starting a regular yoga practice. Of course, before beginning any new exercise regimen, our health and fitness experts recommend consulting with your healthcare provider.
Yoga is a spiritual and physical practice rooted in Indian philosophy that has existed for thousands of years, according to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. There are several different styles of yoga that range from gentle, meditative experiences to more physically intense formats. The mind-body exercise typically consists of doing sequences of physical poses combined with deep breathing techniques.
""Defining 'yoga' is a bit like trying to define a grand concept like spirituality or culture,"" Rayburn says. ""I’ve always been drawn to a dynamic definition that resonates differently depending on the person, time and place. Any practice, both internal and external, that weaves intention, knowledge and affirmative agency can be yoga.""
From improving strength and flexibility to helping manage stress, the benefits of regularly practicing yoga are vast, but the specific benefits you experience will differ based on the type of yoga you do, according to Rayburn. ""Alignment-based yoga can help with strength, flexibility and functionality, while meditational or devotional types of yoga can yield myriad benefits relating to mental and emotional health,"" he says. Some generally well-established yoga health benefits include:
Improved flexibility and balance
A 2016 study in the International Journal of Yoga found improvements in flexibility and balance among a group of male college athletes that practiced yoga twice a week, for a total of 10 weeks. A systematic review from 2019 supports those findings, confirming significant improvements in yogis' lower body flexibility.
Increased strength and muscle tone
One study that evaluated adults participating in a 12-week Hatha yoga intervention saw significant improvements in both cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength. Another study in sedentary adults found that a Hatha yoga regimen was as good as a stretching-strengthening exercise program in improving strength, flexibility, mobility and more.
Enhanced body awareness
Yoga has been long known to improve body awareness, primarily through its ability to connect breath and movement through the practice. A pilot study in 2022 found that a 12-week yoga course for individuals with multiple sclerosis significantly improved their body awareness.
Stress relief
You may feel the stress relief benefits of yoga after just one session. Older adults who practiced yoga regularly for eight weeks reported feeling less stressed — something a salivary cortisol test supported in a 2016 study. What's more, a 2017 study found that middle-aged women secreted lower amounts of cortisol (the stress hormone) after 90 minutes of yoga, compared to resting.
Weight management
A 2013 study analysis concluded that regular yoga practice can help promote weight loss and maintenance, combined with a healthy diet. Another study from 2018 published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity found that a regular yoga practice supported healthy eating, management of emotional eating and even increased capacity to be active.
Injury prevention
Since yoga can improve flexibility and mobility, it can be a great tool for fixing muscle imbalances and alleviating tightness than can contribute to future injuries.
Help with pain management
Scientists named yoga one of the most effective exercises for alleviating chronic pain in a 2017 study review. In a 2020 review of 25 randomized controlled trials, researchers found that 20 studies supported positive outcomes regarding yoga and back pain relief.
Manage chronic disease symptoms
Regular physical activity in general can help prevent several chronic diseases. When it comes to yoga, thousands of study participants in a year-long relaxation program involving meditation, yoga and prayer visited their doctors 43% less than the year before, according to 2015 research from Massachusetts General Hospital. Another set of studies out of UCLA found just 12 minutes of Kirtan Kriya meditation (which involves chanting and finger poses) every day for eight weeks helped decrease the immune system's inflammatory response, which is promising since inflammation levels are tied to pretty much every major disease.
When it comes to the best poses for beginners looking to start a yoga practice, Rayburn suggests starting with any of these common poses — try flowing through the sequence below to create a complete yoga workout at home.
Pro tip: Take your time and hold each movement for a few breaths before moving on to the next one.
This foundational pose can be relaxing and serve as a great reset during a class. If you ever need a second during your flow to regroup, you can always come back to child's pose.
Downward facing dog may be one of the first poses you'll learn in any yoga class, since it is an important part of many yoga practices. It's one of the main poses during sun salutations and something you can return to throughout class, as well.
Another favorite pose of Rayburn's, this one is great for stretching the lower body and opening up the chest.
This pose, also common in sun salutations, is ideal for improving posture as backbends are great for counteracting prolonged sitting.
This powerful pose is great for strengthening the legs, arms and core.
This empowering pose increases balance and strength. If you can't reach your fingertips all the way to the ground, consider utilizing a yoga block.
Great for opening the hips, this popular yoga pose targets the lower body and can provide a fantastic stretch. Ease into the movement and only fold forward if you feel stable once in position.
Another popular backbend, this pose can help improve posture and also relieve lower back pain.
Not only does this standing yoga pose help improve your balance and coordination, but it also focuses on posture and alignment. Engage your core to help steady yourself.
This grounding pose is all about relaxation and quieting the mind. If you feel any tension under your lower back, consider placing a rolled-up blanket beneath your knees.
Whether you're looking for a rigorous workout or a more meditative experience, there are a variety of yoga styles to meet your needs. Yoga was often referred to as a tree in ancient times, with six branches that include Raja (path of meditative focus), Karma (path of service), Bhakti (path of devotion), Jnana (path of wisdom and knowledge), Tantra (path of rituals) and Hatha (path that focuses on mastery of the body). You may gravitate towards one particular branch, but know that you can explore different paths and may find that many of these branches naturally overlap.
In terms of the types of yoga classes offered, some common ones you may encounter include:
If you're brand new to yoga, Rayburn says that taking a class specifically designed for beginners is ideal so you can learn proper form at the very beginning of your yoga journey. In general, you'll want to take your time with the movements and go slow, as the practice is designed to be mindful and purposeful in movement.
If your first class doesn't go as well as you wanted it to, don't get discouraged. ""Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that 'yoga is not for me' just because your first class is not the best experience,"" he says, adding that it may take a few classes to find an instructor that resonates with you and inspires you to practice regularly. Once you find the right class format and instructor, you'll start to feel more empowered by the yoga experience.
While you may be tempted to go hard in the beginning, it is crucial to listen to your body and know your limits. ""Notice if you’re not able to breathe deeply,"" suggests Rayburn. ""The breath can be a great guide for slowing down, modifying or taking a rest."" Also try to differentiate between feeling discomfort versus feeling acute sensations and pain. You can always return back to downward facing dog or child's pose whenever you need to reset during class.
Most yoga studios provide equipment, but check in advance to see if you'll need to bring anything to class. You may want to take your own mat for hygiene purposes, or if you have a particular preference on style and thickness. Some yoga studios will provide accessories for you, but if you're practicing yoga at home through a yoga app or online class, then you'll want to consider having a few things on hand:
When it comes to clothing, Rayburn says it depends on what makes you feel most comfortable. He generally recommends wearing yoga pants that allow you to move freely. Yoga is typically done barefoot, but if you prefer to wear socks, our experts suggest grip socks.

If you’re a beginner to yoga, it can seem intimidating. Between the gravity-defying poses you see on Instagram and the overwhelming array of class options, it can be easy to think of yoga as exclusive. The truth is, yoga is for everyone and you don’t need gymnast-level flexibility to give it a try. In fact, the reason you do yoga isn’t because you’re flexible—it’s to become more flexible in your body as well as your life.
Here, you’ll find everything you need to know about yoga for beginners: the benefits of a regular practice, beginner poses, how to find the right class for you, practicing at home, and more.
The word “yoga” derives from a Sanskrit word that means “to yoke” or “to unite.” This makes sense when you consider that yoga is a practice meant to unite the mind, body, and spirit.
Much of the yoga practiced in the West today focuses strongly on asana, meaning the physical practice, but the physical postures are just one aspect of yoga. There are ancient philosophical texts that define yoga as a state of mind that has nothing to do with physical postures and movements.
“Yoga” is a very old term that originated in India, explains Indu Arora, an Ayurveda and yoga therapist and author of Yoga: Ancient Heritage, Tomorrow’s Vision. “Its roots are found in ancient texts called Vedas, which are about 3,000- to 5,000-year-old texts,” she says.
As Arora explains, yoga is “that harmonious, peaceful, content, still state of mind. Whenever we have found that, we are in that state of yoga.”
That’s why focusing on your breath—pranayama—is considered an essential component of yoga. “Prana” refers to life force or breath sustaining the body; “ayama” means “to extend” or “to draw out.” The two together mean breath extension or control. Some yoga teachers consider pranayama as the most important part of the practice.
When you begin to practice yoga regularly, you’ll unlock a host of health benefits. Because yoga engages the mind, body, and spirit, these span the physical, mental, and emotional realms.
The moving, stretching, and deep breathing during a yoga practice improves blood flow and both stretches and strengthens muscles.
Yoga shows promise for relieving certain kinds of chronic and acute pain—especially low back pain, according to research.
Factors such as stress and a sedentary lifestyle can trigger chronic inflammation, which in turn can raise your risk for disease. Yoga may be a powerful antidote. Studies have found that practicing yoga may help lower blood levels of an inflammation-promoting immune cell called IL-6 and cortisol, also known as the “stress hormone.”
The evidence is overwhelming: Yoga appears to be an effective way to boost heart health, help manage heart conditions, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Yoga has been found to help decrease depressive symptoms and significantly reduce stress and anxiety. Research continues to find that meditation is effective in relieving symptoms of depression as well.
The practice of holding postures, breathing intentionally, and meditating all train you to fine-tune your attention by syncing your breathing with movement, focusing on the subtleties of your inhalations and exhalations, and letting go of distracting thoughts.
Studies have also shown that a regular yoga practice promotes positive emotions and body image. “Yoga has helped me to deal with life struggles,” says Kiesha Battles, yoga teacher and trainer, and co-director of the Yoga Retreat for Women of Color. “It allows me to have more clarity in the way I see things so that I can deal with troubles or problems.”
When practiced consistently, yoga may help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep, decrease sleep disturbances, and improve sleep quality.
RELATED The Benefits of Yoga: 38 Ways Yoga Can Improve Your Life
If you’ve ever browsed yoga class schedules, you’ve likely encountered a slew of options—including some with names that you don’t understand. These typically signify various types of yoga with approaches that vary in intensity, focus, and styles. Following are some styles of yoga you may encounter:
Here are six basic yoga poses that are beginner-friendly. There are many variations of each yoga pose that can help make them more accessible to your unique body.
Although it may look like a simple standing position, Mountain Pose engages your leg muscles and your core, while establishing greater body awareness and alignment.
How to:
Cat Pose can help relieve tension in your low, middle, and upper back, as well as improve posture. This pose is often paired with Cow Pose (see below) for a gentle flow. How to:
Cow Pose can be done on your hands and knees, or even in a seated position during chair yoga. Cow Pose may help increase mobility, especially for people experiencing muscle and joint stiffness. How to:
Cobra Pose may help improve symptoms of chronic low back pain by increasing flexibility and core strength. Though you may see yogis straightening their arms and more deeply arching their backs, it’s okay to stay low to the ground, especially if you’re new to Cobra Pose.
How to:
Child’s Pose and its variations provide a stretch for the lower back and hips. This pose is often recommended for yogis to return to throughout a class or sequence.
How to:
Yogis rest in Savasana at the end of each practice. This pose offers a chance to find inner stillness after the physical movement of a yoga class.
Savasana may provide deep relaxation, which promotes stress reduction.
How to:
There are many different breathwork, or pranayama, techniques, including simply slowing your breath. Another common and traditional form of breathwork is Ujjayi. This type of breathing pattern is approximately equal length inhalations and exhalations and should feel both energizing and relaxing. It’s created by gently constricting the opening of the throat to create some resistance to the passage of air. An effective Ujjayi breath renders a soothing sound.
At the beginning of class, a yoga teacher may guide students through one or more breathing techniques, including Ujjayi as well as:

It’s normal if you feel awkward when you first start practicing yogic breathwork. Try to be patient with yourself and over time, you may become more comfortable and reap the benefits breathwork can offer.
In a study in the International Journal of Yoga, researchers found that pranayama is linked with stress relief, improved cardiovascular health and respiratory function, and enhanced cognition.
A well-known saying goes something like “Movement with awareness is yoga. Movement without awareness is exercise.” That awareness includes attention to your breath as you move throughout the poses.

In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, a text compiled by an ancient sage named Patanjali, many different concepts of yoga are brought together under one umbrella, Arora explains. The result is structured guidance on how to achieve a yogic state of mind.
As Patanjali explains, yoga encompasses eight limbs (or steps) that essentially serve as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. These limbs are a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline, direct attention toward one’s health, and help us acknowledge the spiritual aspects of our nature as humans.
The eight limbs of yoga are:
You don’t need to know a ton about how to do yoga before you attend your first class. “That’s why you’re there—you’re there to learn,” says Susanna Barkataki, yoga teacher trainer and author of Embrace Yoga’s Roots: Courageous Ways to Deepen Your Yoga Practice.
Start by doing a Google search for “Beginner yoga classes near me.” Some yoga studios have class schedules on their websites while others use apps. Most studios prefer that students reserve classes ahead of time, which you can often do online, in order to ensure classes aren’t overbooked and students aren’t turned away at the door.
Classes that are described as foundational, gentle, or beginner are great options if you’re just starting out. So are restorative or yin yoga classes.
Of course, it may help to email or call your local yoga studio to ask whether a particular class is beginner-friendly. If you have any injuries or health conditions, you may also choose to disclose that to the studio or the teacher, who can advise you on which of their classes would best suit your needs.
If you want to try beginner yoga at home before ever stepping foot into a studio, there are tons of free resources online for yogis. Check out these 10-minute beginner yoga videos:

There is no dress code for most yoga classes. But you’ll want to make sure that the fabric you wear is stretchy enough to accommodate movement. While yoga pants are popular, you can wear gym shorts, sweatpants, a sweat-wicking workout top, a t-shirt, a sports bra—anything you’re most comfortable in.
If it’s your first time going to yoga class at a studio, you most likely don’t need to bring anything (aside from a water bottle to stay hydrated). It’s common practice for people to rent a yoga mat from the studio or bring their own. If you borrow a mat, many studios provide sanitizing wipes so you can clean the mat before and after use.
As you practice more, you’ll learn what you need for a comfortable experience. You may choose to purchase your own yoga mat and even, if you practice at home, other props such as blocks and blankets.
Using props is about making yoga comfortable and accessible for you. Yoga instructors will often show various modifications for a single pose using props that the studio provides.
Common yoga props include:
Keep in mind that yoga is a mind-body-spirit practice that is about much more than just fitness. So if your yoga class incorporates some non-movement elements—such as breathwork, meditation, or intention-setting (sankalpa) at the beginning of class—be open to those aspects of the practice.
In India, where yoga originated, it’s a sign of respect to remove your shoes before you enter someone’s home, temple, or practice space. The same is expected in a yoga class.
While many teachers provide hands-on adjustments for students, know that you have the right to decline. Some teachers may ask students to raise their hands at the beginning of class if they do not wish to be touched throughout a practice. You can also tell your teacher directly before the practice begins. Always speak up if any hands-on adjustments make you feel uncomfortable in any way. “I think that’s another piece of the etiquette going both ways,” says Barkataki.
Many, but certainly not all, yoga teachers call poses by their Sanskrit names, in addition to or instead of their English interpretations. Don’t feel like you need to brush up on this ancient Indian language before taking your first yoga class. However, it’s helpful to understand the meaning of certain well-known Sanskrit words and phrases. If you hear something in class you don’t understand, simply ask the teacher to explain it to you after class.
The following are some common yoga terms:

How to Find a Beginner Yoga Class
Basic Yoga Class Etiquette
Common Yoga Terms
Vinyasa Yoga: Vinyasa classes typically comprise a sequence of poses that are moved through with one movement per breath.
Restorative Yoga: A Restorative yoga class typically involves only five or six relaxing poses—supported by props, such as blankets, bolsters, pillows, blocks, or stacks of books—that you linger in for several minutes. The postures are designed to help you to release tension and rest.
Hot Yoga: Any style of yoga practiced in an intentionally heated room is hot yoga. The temperature is believed to encourage increased flexibility, although it’s important to exert caution.
Yin Yoga: A relatively recently developed style, Yin yoga involves variations of seated and supine stretches that are typically held for 3 to 5 minutes to access fascia, a type of connective tissue that is the subject of much research. Exerting subtle tension on fascia can improve flexibility and minimize recovery time from injuries.
Ashtanga Yoga: An athletic and demanding practice based on several set sequences of postures that remain the same, an Ashtanga yoga practice is taught in increasing levels of difficulty. Beginners start with the Primary Series.
Hatha Yoga: Unlike vinyasa, Hatha yoga focuses on individual poses and not the linking of poses from one to the next. The practice is meant to deepen your understanding of each pose.
Yoga Therapy: Any yogic technique used to systematically address physical injury or pain, as well as mental and emotional stress or trauma, can be considered yoga therapy.
Iyengar Yoga: By paying careful attention to the alignment of each posture, Iyengar yoga is the practice of precision. Poses are held for extended periods of time and students are often supported with props to experience the posture’s intended alignment.
Jivamukti Yoga: This style of yoga is defined by incorporating chanting, meditation, pranayama, philosophy, and music into a vigorous vinyasa practice. Jivamukti is a physically and intellectually stimulating type of yoga.
Kundalini Yoga: A blend of spiritual and physical practices, Kundalini yoga includes less of an emphasis on movement and more on dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and the chanting of mantras.
Power Yoga: This practice flows from one pose to the next. Power yoga has many of the same qualities as Ashtanga and some types of vinyasa, including building internal heat, increasing stamina, enhancing strength and flexibility, as well as reducing stress.
Prenatal Yoga: With an emphasis on breathing, stamina, pelvic floor work, restorative poses, and core strength, prenatal yoga can be practiced both during and after pregnancy.
Tantra Yoga: By harnessing and embodying the five forces of Shakti, the divine feminine that represents creativity and change, tantric yoga intends to help you move through the world with more confidence and contentment.
Stand with your big toes touching, heels slightly apart.
Reach your tailbone toward the floor.
Broaden your collarbones and let your arms hang at your sides, palms facing forward.
Hold Mountain Pose for up to 10 breaths.
Start on your hands and knees with your knees directly below your hips and your wrists, elbows, and shoulders in line.
As you exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling and release your head toward the floor without forcing your chin to your chest.
Repeat Cat Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Start on your hands and knees. Make sure your knees are directly below your hips and your wrists; elbows and shoulders are in line.
As you inhale, lift your sitting bones and chest toward the ceiling, allowing your belly to sink toward the floor. Lift your head to look straight forward.
Exhale, coming back to your hands and knees.
Repeat Cow Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Lie on your stomach with your palms on the floor, fingertips in line with the middle of your chest. Place a folded towel or blanket underneath your hip bones for added cushioning. Extend your legs.
Slowly press your palms into the floor and draw your shoulder blades together. Keep your shoulders down.
Keep a deep bend in both arms as you expand your chest forward.
Hold for 5 to 10 breaths and slowly lower yourself back down to the floor.
Begin in a seated position with your bottom on top of your feet, placing a rolled blanket or towel in between if it’s more comfortable.
Touch your big toes together and widen your knees out to the side as you slowly walk your hands out in front of you.
Bring your forehead to the floor. If it’s more accessible, place a book, block, or blanket beneath your forehead.
Stay in this position anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. To come out of Child’s Pose, slowly walk your hands back toward your body and rise up to seated.
Lie down slowly onto your back and soften (but don’t flatten) your lower back onto the floor. If it’s more comfortable, support the back of your head and neck on a folded blanket or towel.
Release your arms to the floor. Rest the backs of your hands on the floor. Make sure your shoulder blades are resting evenly on the floor.
Soften your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. Relax your face.
Try to stay in this pose for at least 5 minutes at the end of your practice. To exit, first roll gently with an exhalation onto one side. Take 2 or 3 breaths. With another exhalation press your hands against the floor and lift your torso, dragging your head slowly after. Your head should always come up last.

Yoga mats: You may be surprised to learn that yoga mats are not a must, says Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga. “You really don’t have to use a yoga mat unless you really want that stickiness, that extra traction,” he explains. In lieu of a mat, you could practice on wood floors, with a towel, or on carpeting, especially if you’re practicing at home.
Yoga Blanket: This item is a staple in restorative yoga and can also be used to support your knees, wrists, and back throughout any practice. Look for a blanket that is thick in texture to ensure you have adequate support, Battles advises.
Yoga Blocks: Blocks are another common prop that effectively brings the floor to you in various poses and adds stability and balance to your practice. Blocks are often used by beginner and experienced yogis alike to help them work within the limitations of their bodies and allow them to find alignment with less strain.
Yoga Straps: Straps, explains Battles, extend your reach in postures. If you have a stiff lower back or tight hamstrings, for example, the strap allows you to find alignment in more poses. You can buy a yoga strap or instead use a long, flexible item like a towel, belt, sweatshirt, or tie.
Asana: Refers to the physical practice of yoga or poses
Chakra: Relates to the seven energetic parts of the body that we can’t see or touch but that connect us to universal energy
Mantra: A word or phrase that is repeated during yoga practice and meditation
Namaste: A sign of respect often said between yoga teachers and their students at the end of class

Reddit's best place for all things yoga.
If you want to learn how to do yoga, you’re in the right place! It will transform your life, but I’ll be the first to admit it can be intimidating to start. What are the poses? What do I wear? Where do I go? It’s a bit overwhelming, but it doesn’t need to be.
Here are a couple resources for you to check out when you have some time:
https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene Disclaimer: I've never actually taken her classes, but the online world raves about her videos. She offers a large variety, so this could be a great place to start. And they are free (yay!)
Just by the titles, these are the ones I would start with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYKMP6rOE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiKJRoX_2uo
Adriene also had a 30 day yoga series that could be worth trying too.
I've done a different 30 day challenge from another girl (Erin Motz - The Bad Yogi) and it was a great way to become familiar with the poses and practice regularly. BONUS: the videos are pretty short so it's easy to fit into your schedule and they are free. Here is the link to day one of her 30 day series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbrutThDk7o
This is my FAVORITE yogi of all time - Rachel Brathen. She is @yoga_girl on insta and I went to her yoga retreat a few years ago and it was amazing. UGH I want to go back! https://oneoeight.com/?gclid=CMX6odvfiNECFdU8gQodmQoMrg I pay $14/month for these classes but they have a 10 day free trial you could check out. They have a huge variety of teachers on there, but I've only taken Rachel's classes and they are so good! and kick my ass. I believe they also have meditation on here (I've never tried it) but that could be cool too.
Anyways - this should be good to at least get you started at home. If you find you're interested it would be worth going to a studio (or two) and see which ones you like. I recommend two things: Try to find a groupon. You can get amazing deals this way! See what new student discounts the studio offers. Many of them have a special deal for students who have never been there before Okay, I just thought of a third point… search for local community (or donation based) yoga classes. I usually donate $5-10 per class.
There you have it! My favorite resources to kick start your yoga practice. Of course - if you have any questions you can ask me. I am here to help :)

Paragraphs:
When you’re brand new to yoga, it can feel intimidating and be difficult to know exactly where and how to get started. Our Yoga for Beginners guide was created specifically for you—to give you all the tips, guidelines, and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. To ensure your success, we highly recommend you read this entire page before attempting any yoga.
Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body, and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment.
Hatha Yoga attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), and shatkarma (internal cleansing). These physical practices are used to purify the body and cultivate prana (life-force energy). Modern Hatha Yoga does not emphasize many of these esoteric practices and instead focuses more on the physical yoga postures.
Regardless of what your goals or intentions are for starting, just the yoga poses themselves is a fantastic form of mental and physical exercise.
Yoga is in no way exclusive—being able to practice yoga does not matter how old you are, how much you weigh, what you do for a living, where you live, or what religion you practice. Yoga is accessible for just about everyone.
If you have a medical condition or a recent injury, it can be challenging or dangerous to do certain types of yoga, specific poses, or breathing techniques. Usually, there are alternatives or modifications that can allow you to practice safely, and many common complaints have specific yoga therapy remedies. If you are recovering from an injury or are in poor health, we recommended consulting with a physician or other qualified health care professional before beginning yoga.
While you may feel some intensity in the belly of your muscles while in a yoga pose, you should never feel pain, especially in the joints. A sharp or intense pain is your body’s signal to tell you to stop, back off, and take it easy.
If you are out of shape or extremely inflexible, we recommend you begin with a gentle practice until you have built up the strength and flexibility for more challenging sequences. If you are a relatively fit and flexible person, you should be able to jump right into a regular hatha yoga class. Once you are familiar with the basic postures, you can explore a vinyasa or flow class. We recommend you avoid Ashtanga, Bikram, or hot yoga until you have built up some physical strength and endurance. It is always best to error on the side of caution and safety and approach yoga slowly and carefully. The best way to know if yoga is for you is to give it a try!
Yoga is typically performed in bare feet on a sticky yoga mat with optional yoga props. The yoga movements and poses require clothes that can stretch and move freely with your body. You can purchase clothing specifically designed for yoga practice, but you can probably put together a comfortable outfit from your existing wardrobe to get started.
Yoga classes may use additional props, the most common being straps, blocks, blankets, and bolsters. You don’t need to purchase these right away as you can easily substitute these items with scarves or neckties, a stack of books, and pillows. If you take classes at a yoga studio, they will provide everything that you need.
We recommend that you start with a short and straightforward yoga session and slowly build up from there. Once you feel comfortable with a few basic beginner yoga postures, you can incorporate them into a sequence and continue to add more challenging poses. Make sure you learn and follow the essential components of a yoga practice: breathing, meditation, intention, asanas, and relaxation.

If you can practice yoga 3 or more times per week, you will see significant improvements in your flexibility, range of motion, strength, balance, inner peace, and overall well being. Ideally, we recommend shorter and more frequent sessions, 20-45 minutes long, and for a total of 3-4 hours spread over several days. Practicing yoga less than this amount will still be beneficial, but you will see smaller improvements over a longer period of time. Like most things, the more time you can dedicate towards it, the more benefits you will receive.

The benefits of yoga are almost endless! Practicing yoga helps build healthy virtues and good values, such as discipline, honesty, devotion, self-inquiry, mindfulness, and non-attachment. Yoga empowers you to make conscious choices toward living a more healthy and fulfilling life. Yoga also helps you:
Patience, commitment, repetition, and consistency are the keys to developing and progressing in the practice of yoga. After you’ve found a style, teacher, and yoga studio that works for you, try these tips:

Practice Yoga for BeginnersOur Yoga for Beginners guide will give you the basic tips, guidelines and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. Meditation BasicsMeditation is a focusing of the mind on a single object, creating the cessation of all thought. As thoughts dissipate, the mind becomes quiet, and we are able to be fully in the present moment. The techniques of meditation are simple and easy to learn, but the ability to keep the mind focused takes time, patience and practice. The benefits of a regular meditation practice include reduction of stress, tension, anxiety and frustration, as well as improved memory, concentration, inner peace and whole body well-being. PranayamaPranayama are breathing exercises developed by the ancient yogis for purification. Prana translates into “life force energy” and Yama translates into “control or mastery of”. Thus, Pranyama is used to control, cultivate, and modify the Prana in the body. Prana is taken in through the air we breathe, and since the pranayama exercises increase the amount of air we take in, they also increase our intake of Prana. For all pranayama (except Kapalabhati), the breath is slow and steady, breathed in and out of the nose and down into the belly. Always sit with a straight spine and a relaxed body. While you are practicing pranayama, let go of any thoughts by focusing on the breathing involved with the pranayama. Yoga Postures Seated Yoga Poses Standing Yoga Poses Prone Yoga Poses Supine Yoga Poses Yoga Posture Sequences Warm-up SequencesUse these sequences of simple stretches to warm up prior to any of the pose sequences. Basic SequencesWhere to start if you are new or a beginner. These posture flows are simple, short and only contain basic postures. Beginning SequencesWhere to start if you have some previous experience with yoga. Build on the basic pose sequences by adding more length and challenge to the flow. For more beginning level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Sun SalutationsOften considered the core of hatha yoga practice, Sun Salutations are traditionally practiced at sunrise to warm and energize the body. We have several Sun Salutation sequences available with varying levels of difficulty, from basic to intermediate. Intermediate SequencesBy adding challenging postures to the beginning sequences, these posture flows are the most complex, vigorous and long. For more intermediate level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Special SequencesLooking for something different? These sequences are designed for specific applications, using combinations of yoga postures for their effects on the physical, mental, emotional and energetic bodies.

Learn Yoga 101: The BasicsYoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques, but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment. Though yoga’s ultimate aim is lofty, its essence is practical and scientific as it emphasizes direct experience and observable results. It is not a religion, but a practice of personal inquiry and exploration. As the cultural and religious diversity of practitioners attest, yogic philosophy speaks to universal truths that can be incorporated within any belief system. Philosophy of YogaThe main philosophy of yoga is simple: mind, body and spirit are all one and cannot be clearly separated. Yet there is a multitude of philosophical ideas developed by looking into the deeper dimensions of the body, mind and spirit. Energy AnatomyThe foundation of all life, of the whole universe, is the subtle life force energy the yogis call ‘prana.’ This mystical energy flows through our bodies and generates our every action – from gross physical movements to minute biochemical processes.Hatha and Tantra yogas have developed a rich description of the anatomy of the subtle or energy body, including the different types of energies, the nadi energy channels and chakra energy centers. These yogas have also developed various methods to increase, cultivate and direct this spiritual energy. Articles on Hatha Yoga Yoga TherapyYoga Therapy is the use of yoga postures, meditation and pranayama to help the body naturally heal and balance itself. Certain yogic practices have been shown to have specific healing qualities in addition to yoga’s inherent ability to create wellness and good health. These pages are not intended to treat or diagnose any medical conditions. A yoga practice should be used to supplement conventional therapy. Please consult with a health care professional before starting a yoga program, as some yogic techniques can be harmful if practiced with certain conditions. Please see our site’s terms and conditions for our complete disclaimer. The postures listed under each condition are for general use and will be most effective if professionally modified for personal use by a yoga therapist. Not all of the postures listed are required for practice, use only what feels right for your physical condition and ability. These pages are only a starting point to help your body heal. Experiment and pay attention to what practices make you feel better and improve your condition. Practice slowly and gently as over exertion could cause your condition to worsen. Yoga Therapy Guides:

Tell us about your smile and whitening history over a short quiz.
We’ll create the perfect formula based on your responses.
Use daily for 6 days and say “hello” to your new pearly whites!


""I had to come here to say something. Normally I have excruciating pain with crest white strips and this other brand I got from the dentist. Both of which didn’t whiten my teeth very much. So, I had low hopes for laughland. I got the formula made for highest sensitivity, and I left it on for I think 12 minutes. Just after the first day my teeth look 2 shades whiter. I’m actually really shocked.""
""My teeth had gotten so yellow that I didn't like smiling - especially when I wore lipstick, it made the teeth look more icky. 6 treatments later, it's gotten SO much whiter and I'm wearing lipstick again :)""
""I thought hey worth a shot not really expecting anything great. Wow was I wrong! This has absolutely worked wonders on my teeth! Refill kit has been ordered! I’m obsessed!""
""I. Hate. Whitening. Kits. Except this one. It's easy to use, doesn't create a huge mess, is comfortable (even for small-mouthed folks like me!), and doesn't make your teeth feel slimy and taste weird. Plus, it's SO EFFECTIVE. Worth every penny.""
""This is my best purchase ever. This item OVER-Delivers. My teeth are sparkling and I had ZERO pain. Great Job Laughland.""
""LOVE THIS! My coworkers have been throwing compliments left and right about how my teeth have been shining. THANK YOU!""
Laughland is the only whitening brand to create custom whitening formulas based on your quiz profile. Just as a dentist would prescribe a specific whitening treatment for you, we can optimize the strength of the whitening serum to your unique sensitivity levels, dental history and diet. Hence, our formulas are 3x more effective and clinically tested to show a 74% improvement in whiteness. It's the closest you'll get to a dentist, without having to go to one!
While you'll begin to see differences after your first 10+ minute treatment, but the most noticeable changes will come after 6 days of consecutive whitening treatments. You'll be pleasantly surprised :)
Each kit contains 3 syringes that last for 6 treatments. Results can be immediately noticeable, and lasts months depending on your diet and brushing habits. We recommend users to re-whiten every 2-3 months or as-needed to maintain a shine all year round.
Veneers, caps, implants, bonding or bridges aren’t designed to be whitened, however Laughland can whiten the surrounding teeth to maintain the same shade as your dental work.
We offer a flexible subscription to save you the trouble of re-ordering manually.
You can manage your subscription via your account or by emailing us at team@mylaughland.com anytime.
Our NanoLight technology LED light helps with teeth whitening by activating the ingredients in the whitening gel used during the treatment. Your custom gel contains a variety of bleaching agents that breaks down the stains on the surface of the teeth. When the light is shone on the teeth, it activates the whitening gel, speeding up the chemical reaction and helping the bleaching agent penetrate deeper into the enamel. This results in a more effective and efficient teeth whitening treatment, giving you a brighter and more confident smile. It is important to note that the LED light alone will not change the color of your teeth, but rather enhances the effectiveness of the whitening gel.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
The Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a compact, fast and useful laptop that offers great performance for everyday tasks for everyone in the family due to its portability, let me further explain. The Chromebook 311 has a nice 11.6 inch screen, and it is perfect for movability. It is also lightweight just less than 3 lbs. so it is easy to carry around, either at home, class or maybe at a favorite spot. I like how it feels, it feels sturdy and durable all around and it can withstand minor bumps and drops. It is powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and it has 4GB of RAM, so it easily handles everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, and streaming best of all it does it well. It works great wirelessly, using Wi-Fi connection all around the house it has worked flawlessly. It does have an HD Webcam with dual built in speakers so our kids can take an online class or just to communicate with others, and it does come with a webcam cover for privacy. Another thing we like about the Chromebook is its good battery life. It can last up to 8 hours on a single charge and that is plenty for most people including our kids at home as well as us adults. Since the Chromebook runs on Chrome OS, it is like having my Android cell phone with a bigger screen, keyboard and touchpad which they are responsive and comfortable to use by the way. The system is easy to use and I can access my Google Drive, Google Docs as well as other applications from the Google App store. Overall, the Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a great choice for family like ours, that we can share it since it is very portable and reliable for everyday use. Now that the kids have recently returned to school, they are ready to use the Chromebook too.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
I am quite pleased with the newest Acer 311. The build quality is decent despite being all plastic. That makes it lighter and more portable. The screen can lay 180° flat, stays up, and does not wobble. The keys have very good travel and feel very tactile. The trackpad is plastic but has a nice feel and is clicky. The bezels are bigger than I’d prefer, making the 11.6” display seem smaller. The HD (1366 x 768) screen has acceptable brightness but is a bit washed out and has pretty bad viewing angles. Nevertheless, I can see all text, graphics, and vide clearly. Sadly, there is no touchscreen support. The sound is what you’d expect from a small laptop. OK volume, clear, but no bass whatsoever. About connectivity, we have a USB-C 3.2 and a USB-A 3.1 port. The USB-C doubles as a power delivery and display port. The laptop is Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth compatible and works well and fast. There’s also a 3.8mm audio headphone jack. The N4500 CPU, Intel UHD Graphics, 4GB LPDDR4X memory combined make for a very smooth Chromebook workflow. I had several internet tabs open, (within reason), watched video, did productivity work, played super-basic games, and yes, streamed games with relatively no issues or slowdown. I did notice the laptop got bit warm but nothing uncomfortable and the fans were not loud at all. The 64GB storage is low but considering that this is designed to be used with cloud support, makes it sufficient. The battery life ranges between 8-10 hours depending on the use -good enough for a full workday. The 720P webcam is nothing to write home about but good enough for those basic video calls. I appreciate the included security cam cover. In the end, I think this Chromebook is quite portable and capable of handling everyday tasks. It’s perfect for student use and for anyone that is looking for simplicity and security. While the price could have been a bit lower, this is a great budget option.

This is a basic Chromebook, without any frills. But if your needs are limited, it does get the job done. == Build Quality == The packaging is minimal and without frills, but that is OK as I would rather the money go towards the computer than something that will be thrown away. Once you open up the machine itself, it seems to be decently built. It is all plastic construction, but you expect that for this price. The bottom features no air vents at all, and this machine has no moving parts; not even a single fan. But given the limited power, this is perfectly acceptable, and means that there is less to break in the future. == Peripherals == Being a budget device, the name of the game is giving you basic functionality for as little money as possible, and this has been done well. Obviously some corners were cut, but nothing was cut back in such a way that caused any problems. Everything here falls squarely in the “usable but not impressive” category. The keyboard is acceptable. It works and feels good, but it is not backlit at all. The trackpad is also well done, despite having a plastic surface. Multi-touch gestures also work well, but it is not especially smooth or gigantic. But it is adequate, and that is enough for this type of machine. There is a camera above the display that is more than good enough for Zoom or Teams meetings, and although it lacks a privacy shutter, Acer thought to include a slim self-adhesive shutter in the package that you can apply if you desire. The display itself is perhaps a little disappointing, being only 1366 by 768, and the contrast and brightness are nothing special. Of note is that the color seems to shift a little bit as you move your head from side to side, but once again, higher quality brings higher prices, and this display is certainly usable. But the largest surprise is that the speakers are surprisingly good given the size and price. There is actually more bass and volume than I expected. As to the included IO, other than the expected BlueTooth and WiFi, it features a single USB-A rated for up to 5Mbps, one 3.5mm audio jack, and a single USB-C port that is used for charging, adding external devices, and can do video out. This computer had no problems driving an external 3440 by 1440 display, if that is the sort of thing that you need. A USB-C power supply is included, but this can use any USB-C charger large enough to drive a laptop. Note that there is nothing inside that is upgradable. Everything is soldered down to the main board. == Performance == They say that it is what is inside that counts, and this does not have much inside, but for many it will be enough. This Chromebook uses a dual-core x86 processor backed up by 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of flash storage. Note that there is no way to expand anything; neither RAM nor SSD. The performance is perfectly OK for light office tasks. Google Docs and Google Sheets both work well, as do the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Sometimes the Firefox browser seemed a little sluggish when starting up or trying to type in a new URL, but they got the job done, even though I had to wait a second or two longer than I was accustomed to. Also inside is a 33 WH battery, which gives around seven hours of life away from a charger with light usage. == Software == The thing about a Chromebook is that it is a Chromebook. You are limited in the apps that you can run. But with that being understood, it can run most Android apps. I had no problems installing Google Docs and Sheets, and Microsoft Teams installed easily, as well as BitWarden password manager. The only issues that I encountered were that I could not install Microsoft Outlook, and the Amazon shopping app (but Amazon Prime Video was not a problem). There is also an option to get a Linux terminal window up, but I am not sure how useful that will be to most people in the market for this type of computer. == Summary == This is a machine with several compromises, but it is built to hit an affordable price point. If you need a Chromebook, and this is a machine that you can afford, then it is worthy of consideration. All of the compromises are acceptable, and none of them are deal-breakers.

Paragraphs:
The British government has banned the phrase fake news from appearing in official papers or documents after ruling the term is ""poorly defined and misleading.""
Instead, ministers will have to use the words disinformation when referring to the act of purposely spreading false information and misinformation when it occurs inadvertently.
The suggestion to ban the phrase often used by President Donald Trump during his attacks on the media was made in a report by the U.K. Parliament's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee, as the term fake news is ""bandied around with no clear idea of what it means.""
""The term has taken on a variety of meanings, including a description of any statement that is not liked or agreed with by the reader,"" the recommendation said.
The British government responded: ""We agree that 'fake news' is a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.
""Over the past several months during its work on this issue the Government has sought to move away from 'fake news' and instead has sought to address 'disinformation' and wider online manipulation.
""In our work we have defined disinformation as the deliberate creation and sharing of false and/or manipulated information that is intended to deceive and mislead audiences, either for the purposes of causing harm, or for political, personal or financial gain. 'Misinformation' refers to the inadvertent sharing of false information.""
However, British politicians will still be allowed to use the phrase if they wish while speaking in the House of Commons, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Avoiding the phrase was one of 42 recommendations made in the committee's report, titled ""Disinformation and 'Fake News.'"" The interim report, published in July, warned that ""democracy is at risk"" if more isn't done to combat alleged foreign interference in elections or the use of manipulation of personal data to spread disinformation.
The interim report was set up in the wake of continuing concerns over Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
Only three of the report's 42 recommendations were accepted outright by the British government, with four recommendations rejected, the committee confirmed in a statement.
Damian Collins, the committee's chair and a Conservative member of Parliament for Folkestone and Hythe, said he is ""disappointed"" by the government's response to the report.
""We need to see a more coordinated approach across government to combat campaigns of disinformation being organized by Russian agencies seeking to disrupt and undermine our democracy,"" Collins said. ""The government's response gives us no real indication of what action is being taken on this important issue.""

Paragraphs:
Deepfake videos are a portmanteau word - 'deep' from 'deep learning' and 'fake', obviously, from 'fake'. Deep learning is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) method which uses multiple layers of machine learning algorithms to extract progressively higher-level features from raw input. It's capable of learning from unstructured data - such as the human face. For instance, an AI can gather data on your physical movements.
That data can then be processed in order to create a Deepfake video through a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). This is another kind of specialized machine learning system. Two neural networks are used to compete with each other in learning the characteristics of a training set (for instance, photographs of faces) and then generating new data with the same characteristics (new 'photographs').
Because such a network keeps testing the images it creates against the training set, the fake images become increasingly convincing. This makes Deepfake an ever more potent threat. Plus, GANs can fake other data besides photos and video. In fact, the same Deepfake machine learning and synthesizing techniques can be used to fake voices.

High profile Deepfake examples are not hard to find. One example of a Deepfake is the video issued by actor Jordan Peele in which he used real footage of Barack Obama merged with his own impression of Obama to issue a warning against Deepfake videos. He then showed how the two halves of the merged video looked when separated. His advice? We need to question what we see.
A video of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appearing to talk about how Facebook ’controls the future’ via stolen user data - notably on Instagram. The original video comes from a speech he gave on Russian election interference - just 21 seconds of that speech were enough to synthesize the new video. However, the voice impersonation wasn't as good as Jordan Peele's Obama and gave the truth away.
But even less well-made fakes can have a remarkable impact. A video of Nancy Pelosi 'drunk' scored millions of views on YouTube – but it was simply a fake made by slowing down a video artificially to give the effect of her slurring her words. And many celebrity women have found themselves 'starring' in revenge porn made by morphing their faces into porn films and images.
Deepfake videos have been used for political purposes, as well as for personal revenge. But increasingly they're being used in major attempts at blackmail and fraud.
The CEO of a British energy firm was tricked out of $243,000 by a voice Deepfake of the head of his parent company requesting an emergency transfer of funds. The fake was so convincing that he didn't think to check; the funds were wired not to the head office, but to a third party's bank account. The CEO only became suspicious when his 'boss' requested another transfer. This time, alarm bells rang - but it was too late to get back the funds he'd already transferred.
In France, a recent fraud didn't use Deepfake tech, but used impersonation, together with meticulous copying of Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian's office and its furnishings, to defraud senior executives of millions of euros. Fraudster Gilbert Chikli is alleged to have disguised himself as the minister to ask wealthy individuals and company executives for ransom money to liberate French hostages in Syria; he's currently standing trial.

It's also possible that Deepfake authors could blackmail company presidents by threatening to publish a damaging Deepfake video unless they're paid off. Or intruders could get into your network simply by synthesizing a video call from your Chief Information Officer, tricking employees into giving up passwords and privileges, which then lets hackers run riot all over your sensitive databases.
Deepfake porn videos have already been used to blackmail female reporters and journalists, such as Rana Ayyub in India, who exposes abuses of power. As the technology becomes cheaper, expect to see more uses of Deepfake to blackmail and defraud.
Legislation is already beginning to address the threats of Deepfake videos. For instance, in the state of California, two bills passed last year made aspects of Deepfake illegal - AB-602 banned the use of human image synthesis to make pornography without the consent of the people depicted and AB-730 banned manipulation of images of political candidates within 60 days of an election.
But is this going far enough? Fortunately, cyber-security companies are coming up with more and better detection algorithms all the time. These analyze the video image and spot the tiny distortions which are created in the ‘faking’ process. For instance, current Deepfake synthesizers model a 2D face, and then distort it to fit the 3D perspective of the video; looking at which way the nose is pointing is a key giveaway.
Deepfake videos are still at a stage where you can spot the signs yourself. Look for the following characteristics of a Deepfake video:
But as Deepfakes get better, you'll get less help from your own eyes and more from a good cyber-security program.
Some emerging technologies are now helping video makers authenticate their videos. A cryptographic algorithm can be used to insert hashes at set intervals during the video; if the video is altered, the hashes will change. AI and blockchain can register a tamper-proof digital fingerprint for videos. It's similar to watermarking documents; the difficulty with video is that the hashes need to survive if the video is compressed for use with different codecs.
Another way to repel Deepfake attempts is to use a program that inserts specially designed digital ‘artifacts’ into videos to conceal the patterns of pixels that face detection software uses. These then slow down Deepfake algorithms and lead to poor quality results — making the chances of successful Deepfaking less likely.
But technology isn't the only way to protect against Deepfake videos. Good basic security procedures are remarkably efficient at countering Deepfake.
For instance, having automatic checks built into any process for disbursing funds would have stopped many Deepfake and similar frauds. You can also:
Remember that if Deepfake starts to be deployed by hackers in their attempts to break into home and business networks, then basic cyber-security best practice will play a vital role when it comes to minimizing the risk:
Deepfake keeps evolving. Two years ago, it was really easy to tell Deepfake videos by the clunky quality of the movement and the fact that the faked person never seemed to blink. But the latest generation of fake videos has evolved and adapted.
There are estimated to be over 15,000 Deepfake videos out there right now. Some are just for fun, while others are trying to manipulate your opinions. But now that it only takes a day or two to make a new Deepfake, that number could rise very rapidly.

h2: Top stories

Paragraphs:
Conspiracy theories claiming 5G technology helps transmit coronavirus have been condemned by the scientific community.
Videos have been shared on social media showing mobile phone masts on fire in Birmingham and Merseyside - along with the claims.
The UK's mobile networks have reported 20 cases of masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital.
The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.
TV regulator Ofcom is assessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmes in which he cast doubts on media outlets for their attempts to debunk the claims.
But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible.
The conspiracy theories have been branded ""the worst kind of fake news"" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis.
Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus.
These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US.
They appear to fall broadly in to two camps:
One claims 5G can suppress the immune system, thus making people more susceptible to catching the virus.
The other suggests the virus can somehow be transmitted through the use of 5G technology.
Both these notions are ""complete rubbish,"" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading.
Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside, prompting investigations
""The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,"" Dr Clarke says.
""Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.""
While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect.
""Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.""
The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.
It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds.
""The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,"" he says.
It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology.
There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece: Does 5G pose health risks?
Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, saying there was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses.
But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated.
Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were ""concerning,"" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is ""absolutely no credible evidence for the link"".
Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes.
Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

h1: How Teens In The Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News
h2: Sections
h2: Company
h2: Follow Us

Paragraphs:
BuzzFeed News identified more than 100 pro-Trump websites being run from a single town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
BuzzFeed Founding Editor, Canada
BuzzFeed Contributor
""This is the news of the millennium!"" said the story on WorldPoliticus.com. Citing unnamed FBI sources, it claimed Hillary Clinton will be indicted in 2017 for crimes related to her email scandal.
""Your Prayers Have Been Answered,"" declared the headline.
For Trump supporters, that certainly seemed to be the case. They helped the baseless story generate over 140,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.
Meanwhile, roughly 6,000 miles away in a small town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a young man watched as money began trickling into his Google AdSense account.
Over the past year, the Macedonian town of Veles (population 45,000) has experienced a digital gold rush as locals launched at least 140 US politics websites. These sites have American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, and USADailyPolitics.com. They almost all publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the US.
The young Macedonians who run these sites say they don't care about Donald Trump. They are responding to straightforward economic incentives: As Facebook regularly reveals in earnings reports, a US Facebook user is worth about four times a user outside the US. The fraction-of-a-penny-per-click of US display advertising — a declining market for American publishers — goes a long way in Veles. Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook — and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters.
As a result, this strange hub of pro-Trump sites in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is now playing a significant role in propagating the kind of false and misleading content that was identified in a recent BuzzFeed News analysis of hyperpartisan Facebook pages. These sites open a window into the economic incentives behind producing misinformation specifically for the wealthiest advertising markets and specifically for Facebook, the world's largest social network, as well as within online advertising networks such as Google AdSense.
""Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that 'if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,'"" said a university student in Veles who started a US politics site, and who agreed to speak on the condition that BuzzFeed News not use his name.
Sample stories from US politics sites run by Macedonians.
Using domain name registration records and online searches, BuzzFeed News identified over 100 active US politics websites being run from Veles. The largest of these sites have Facebook pages that boast hundreds of thousands of followers.
BuzzFeed News also identified another 40 US politics domains registered by people in Veles that are no longer active. (An April report from the Macedonian website Meta.mk identified six pro-Trump sites being run from Veles. A Guardian report identified 150 politics sites.)
Their reasons for launching these sites are purely financial, according to the Macedonians with whom BuzzFeed News spoke.
""I started the site for a easy way to make money,"" said a 17-year-old who runs a site with four other people. ""In Macedonia the economy is very weak and teenagers are not allowed to work, so we need to find creative ways to make some money. I'm a musician but I can't afford music gear. Here in Macedonia the revenue from a small site is enough to afford many things.""
Most of the posts on these sites are aggregated, or completely plagiarized, from fringe and right-wing sites in the US. The Macedonians see a story elsewhere, write a sensationalized headline, and quickly post it to their site. Then they share it on Facebook to try and generate traffic. The more people who click through from Facebook, the more money they earn from ads on their website.
Earlier in the year, some in Veles experimented with left-leaning or pro–Bernie Sanders content, but nothing performed as well on Facebook as Trump content.
""People in America prefer to read news about Trump,"" said a Macedonian 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com.
BuzzFeed News' research also found that the most successful stories from these sites were nearly all false or misleading.
For example, the most successful post BuzzFeed News found from a Macedonian site is based on a story from a fake news website. The headline on the story from ConservativeState.com was ""Hillary Clinton In 2013: 'I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They’re Honest And Can’t Be Bought.'"" The post is a week old and has racked up an astounding 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. (To put that into perspective, the New York Times' exclusive story that revealed Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns generated a little more than 175,000 Facebook interactions in a month.)
The viral Clinton story was sourced from TheRightists.com, a site that admits it publishes both real and fake content. According to emails released by WikiLeaks, Clinton said in a private speech to Goldman Sachs that she would like to see more successful business people enter politics. But she did not mention Donald Trump in any way. The quote used in the headline is false.
The original hoax from The Rightists.
Four of the five most successful posts from the Macedonian sites BuzzFeed News identified are false. They include the false claim that the pope endorsed Trump, and the false claim that Mike Pence said Michelle Obama is the ""most vulgar first lady we've ever had."" Those four posts together generated more than 1 million shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. That resulted in huge traffic and significant ad revenue for the owners of these sites, with many people being misinformed along the way.
The Macedonians BuzzFeed News spoke to said the explosion in pro-Trump sites in Veles means the market has now become crowded, making it harder to earn money. The people who launched their sites early in 2016 are making the most money, according to the university student. He said a friend of his earns $5,000 per month, ""or even $3,000 per day"" when he gets a hit on Facebook.
The 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com with a partner said he also runs health websites in addition to the US politics site. They launched the site in early 2016 and it's now averaging 1 million page views a month, said his partner. (The teens declined to share revenue figures.)
The 17-year-old and his three partners are still waiting for Google's AdSense program to approve their site for ads. As of now, they're only generating about 800 views a day and aren't earning any revenue. The university student launched his site in August and stopped updating it in order to focus on another, more successful site he has that's focused on health and well-being. He estimated there are ""thousands"" of health-related sites being run out of Veles. US politics is just this year's opportunity, thanks to a combination of Trump and Facebook.
""I stopped because I didn't really enjoy doing it and we didn't actually make any money from it since there are so many people posting already,"" the university student said. ""The people who started early are the ones reaping the rewards.""
Aside from the allure of easy money, they also have an element of pride that web-savvy people — including teenagers — in a small country like Macedonia can earn money by gaming Facebook, Google, and Americans.
""A good chunk of the world thinks Macedonia is primitive, but that is not true,"" the 17-year-old said.
The young men running these sites know the Trump traffic bonanza will soon come to an end. They expect traffic and revenue to decline significantly once the election is over. But they also hold out hope that a Trump win will keep their sites afloat.
""If Trump loses I plan to redirect my site to sports,"" the 16-year-old's partner said. ""It means that there will be no more politics [worth covering].""

Paragraphs:
On Wikipedia, trusted users may be appointed as administrators (also referred to as admins, sysops or janitors),[1]: 327  following a successful request for adminship. Currently, there are 847 administrators on the English Wikipedia.[2] Administrators have additional technical privileges compared with other editors, such as being able to protect and delete pages and being able to block users from editing pages.
On Wikipedia, becoming an administrator is often referred to as ""being given [or taking up] the mop"",[3] a term which has also been used elsewhere.[4] In 2006, The New York Times reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were ""geographically diverse"".[5] In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was ""running out of administrators"", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed administrators each month, but in the first half of 2012, only nine in total were appointed.[6][7]
However, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder, denied that this was a crisis or that Wikipedia was running out of admins, saying, ""The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on.""[8] Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is ""not a big deal"", and that ""It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.""[9]
In his 2008 book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual, John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role.[10] Instead, he says, admins usually ""delete pages"" and ""protect pages involved in edit wars"".[10] Wikipedia administrators are not employees or agents of the Wikimedia Foundation.[11]
While the first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales in October 2001,[12] administrator privileges on Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA).[1] Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be ""akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court"" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, ""It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point"", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was ""prove you weren't a bozo"".[6]
Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after ""extensive work on the wiki"".[1] While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision that can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a ""request"" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators.[13] This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et al. quoted that ""Prior to mid-2005, RfAs typically did not attract much attention. Since then, it has become quite common for RfAs to attract huge numbers of RfA groupies who all support one another"",[14] with the record number of votes in one RfA as of May 2022 being 468 for the RfA of longtime editor Tamzin Hadasa Kelly, which was supported by 340 users and opposed by 116 amidst controversy over their criticism of supporters of Donald Trump.[15]
Once granted administrator privileges, a user has access to additional functions in order to perform certain duties.[6] These include ""messy cleanup work"",[1] deletion of articles deemed unsuitable, protecting pages (restricting editing privileges to that page),[16]: 66  and blocking the accounts of disruptive users.[1][6] Blocking a user must be done according to Wikipedia's policies and a reason must be stated for the block, which will be permanently logged by the software.[1]: 401 [16]: 120  Use of this privilege to ""gain editing advantages"" is considered inappropriate.[1]
A 2013 scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors.[17] This corresponds to a modality of plural voting. Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007, with the goal of determining which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's Guide to requests for adminship[18] were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin.[4] In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw, which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. They found that they could ""classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates.""[19]

Paragraphs:
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).
As well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration.
Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data.
Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server.
There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
After the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.
In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, JumpStation was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot.
In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.
Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions.
The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).
Static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using socket programming.
Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[3] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.
By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as Xpath can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.
There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of ""bots"" for specific verticals with no ""man in the loop"" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
The pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[4] are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[5]
Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning. This method enables more intelligent and flexible data extraction, accommodating complex and dynamic web content.
The world of web scraping offers a variety of software tools designed to simplify and customize the process of data extraction from websites. These tools vary in their approach and capabilities, making web scraping accessible to both novice users and advanced programmers.
Some advanced web scraping software can automatically recognize the data structure of a web page, eliminating the need for manual coding. Others provide a recording interface that allows users to record their interactions with a website, thus creating a scraping script without writing a single line of code. Many tools also include scripting functions for more customized extraction and transformation of content, along with database interfaces to store the scraped data locally.
Web scraping tools are versatile in their functionality. Some can directly extract data from APIs, while others are capable of handling websites with AJAX-based dynamic content loading or login requirements. Point-and-click software, for instance, empowers users without advanced coding skills to benefit from web scraping. This democratizes access to data, making it easier for a broader audience to leverage the power of web scraping.
Some platforms provide not only tools for web scraping but also opportunities for developers to share and potentially monetize their scraping solutions. By leveraging these tools and platforms, users can unlock the full potential of web scraping, turning raw data into valuable insights and opportunities.
[6]
The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[7]
In the United States, website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA""), and (3) trespass to chattel.[8] However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.
U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of ""scrapers"" or ""robots"" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[9][10] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[11]
One of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[12] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[13]
Southwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of ""Computer Fraud and Abuse"" and has led to ""Damage and Loss"" and ""Unauthorized Access"" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes ""Interference with Business Relations"", ""Trespass"", and ""Harmful Access by Computer"". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as ""Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment"", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[14] In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in Craigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[15]
While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[16] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[17] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly ""excessively crawled"" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[18] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.
In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[19]
In Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[20][21] In Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.
The Ninth Circuit ruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA in hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in Van Buren v. United States which narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[22] On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[23]
Internet Archive collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.[citation needed]
In February 2006, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[24]
In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law. In the case of Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland's High Court ruled Ryanair's ""click-wrap"" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[25] The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[26]
On April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[27] The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[28]
In Australia, the Spam Act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[29][30]
Leaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate the Information Technology Act, 2000, which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource.
The administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot. Some techniques include:

Popular Web Scraping Tools
BeautifulSoup: A Python library that provides simple methods for extracting data from HTML and XML files.
Scrapy: An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python that allows you to extract the data, process it, and store it.
Octoparse: A no-code web scraping tool that offers a user-friendly interface for extracting data from websites without needing programming skills.
ParseHub: Another no-code web scraper that can handle dynamic content and works with AJAX-loaded sites.
Apify: A platform that offers a wide range of scraping tools and the ability to create custom scrapers.
InstantAPI.ai: An AI-powered tool that transforms any web page into personalized APIs instantly, offering advanced data extraction and customization.
Blocking an IP address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and DNSRBL. This will also block all browsing from that address.
Disabling any web service API that the website's system might expose.
Bots sometimes declare who they are (using user agent strings) and can be blocked on that basis using robots.txt; 'googlebot' is an example. Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.
Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic
Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a CAPTCHA. Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges. They can be triggered because the bot is: 1) making too many requests in a short time, 2) using low-quality proxies, or 3) not covering the web scraper’s fingerprint properly.[31]
Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well. However, many such solutions are not very effective.[32]
Locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.
Obfuscation using CSS sprites to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses, at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users.
Because bots rely on consistency in the front-end code of a target website, adding small variations to the HTML/CSS surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process.
Websites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the robots.txt file and allow partial access, limit the crawl rate, specify the optimal time to crawl and more.

Paragraphs:

Wikipedia[c] is a free content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history,[3][4] and is consistently ranked among the ten most visited websites; as of August 2024[update], it was ranked fourth by Semrush,[5] and seventh by Similarweb.[6] Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[7]
Initially only available in English, editions of Wikipedia in more than 300 other languages have been developed. The English Wikipedia, with its over 6.9 million articles, is the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 63 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024[update].[W 1] In July 2024, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic was from the United States, followed by Japan at 6.2%, the United Kingdom at 5.8%, Russia at 5.2%, Germany at 5%, and the remaining 51% split among other countries.[8]
Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, and culture. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[9][10] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward[3][11][12] while becoming an important fact-checking site.[13][14] Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]
Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[19] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[20] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[W 2] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[22][W 3] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[W 4] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.[W 5]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001[20] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[W 6] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[22] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[23][24] Its integral policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[W 7] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[22] Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.[25]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[W 8][W 9] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[26]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[W 10] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[27][W 11]
After an early period of exponential growth,[28] the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[29] The edition reached 3 million articles in August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[W 12] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to ""increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits"".[28] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[30][31][32]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[33][34] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[35] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.[36] Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".[37] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, ""The Decline of Wikipedia"", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[38] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[39] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.""[40] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[41][42]
In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks.[43] With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).[43] This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.[44] In 2014, it received 8 billion page views every month.[W 13] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ""according to the ratings firm comScore"".[45] As of March 2023[update], it ranked 6th in popularity, according to Similarweb.[46] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".[47][48]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.[49] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.[50][W 14]
In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia;[51] in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument;[52] and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.[53] In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.[54][55] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.[56]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it ""had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.""[57] Varma added, ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.""[57] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].""[57] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[58] As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[59] from which cloud computing was the most cited page.[60]
On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called ""Vector 2022"".[61][62] It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.[62][W 15] The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.[61][63]
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.[64]
Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[W 16] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.[W 17][65] A frequently vandalized article can be ""semi-protected"" or ""extended confirmed protected"", meaning that only ""autoconfirmed"" or ""extended confirmed"" editors can modify it.[W 17] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes.[W 18] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as ""perhaps the most important"" means at its disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".[66]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[W 19] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.[67] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[68] However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversity the editing community.[69]
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.[e][70] On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.[W 20] ""New pages patrol"" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[W 21]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".[71]
Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.[72] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.[W 22]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.[73][74] However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.[75]
In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[75] It remained uncorrected for four months.[75] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[76][77] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".[75] The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[78]
Wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".[W 23][79] It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,[80] and criticized as creating a competitive[81] and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles.[82][83] Research has focused on, for example, impoliteness of disputes,[84][85] the influence of rival editing camps,[86][87] the conversational structure,[88] and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources.[89][90]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.[91][92] Yasseri contended that simple reverts or ""undo"" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on ""mutually reverting edit pairs"", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism, and Muhammad.[92] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[92] In 2020, researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia.[93]
Editors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia, with roughly 500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies.[94]
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.[W 24][W 25] By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.[W 26][W 27] In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the ""official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation"".[W 28]
The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the ""Five pillars"", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.[W 29] The five pillars are:
The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.[95] Editors can enforce the rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.[W 30] Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[W 19]
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[W 31] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.[W 32] Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[W 33] It must not present original research.[W 34] A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.[W 31] Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[W 35] This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.[96] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[W 36] As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.[97]
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[98][99] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[W 37]
Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for ""adminship"",[100] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[W 38] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[W 38]
By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.[101] In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.[102]
Wikipedia has delegated some administrative functions to bots, such as when granting privileges to human editors. Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors.[97]
Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".[W 23]
Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field.[103] Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers.[103]: 62  A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.[103]: 83 
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.[104] Statistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[105] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.[104]
Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).[f] Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).[104] Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.[W 39] When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.[104]
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated ""talk"" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.[108] Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".[W 40]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[109] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?"" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[110] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".[111] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.""[112] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[113]
The English Wikipedia has 6,905,069 articles, 48,204,582 registered editors, and 120,034 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.[W 41] Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".[114] Editors who do not log in are in some sense ""second-class citizens"" on Wikipedia,[114] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[115] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.[115]
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".[116] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.""[111] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".[111]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[117] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[118] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".[119]
Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[120] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[121] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[121] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".[122] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[123]
Distribution of the 63,891,853 articles in different language editions (as of November 2, 2024)[W 42]
There are currently 339 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of November 2024, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, German, French, Swedish, and Dutch Wikipedias.[W 43] The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013[update] had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Waray, Arabic, and Portuguese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Indonesian, Serbian, Korean, Norwegian, and Turkish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.[W 44][W 43] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.9 million articles. As of January 2021,[update] the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.[W 45]
Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[W 46] or points of view.[W 47]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.[W 48][125]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".[W 49] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[W 50] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[W 51] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[W 52] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[W 52] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[W 32]
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer ""interwiki links"", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.[127][W 53]
A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English Wikipedia.[126]
On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled ""The Future of Wikipedia"", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that ""the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.""[128] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.[128]
In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[128]
Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.[update][129][103] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of ""truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods"".[130] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's ""undue-weight policy"", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[131][132][133]
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an ""ax to grind"" on the topic.[130][134] A 2008 article in Education Next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.[135] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that ""Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.""[136]
Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much ""leftist bias"".[137] Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a ""propaganda"" for the left-leaning ""establishment"" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.[138] In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.[139] Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a ""western cultural bias"" (or ""pro-western bias"")[140] or ""Eurocentric bias"",[141] reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, ""similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography"". Carwil Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship [142] and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a ""decolonization"" of Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors.[143]
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[144] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that ""the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.""[145] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects ""a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors"" in science articles, ""Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.""[146]
Others raised similar critiques.[147] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,[148][149] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.[150] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a ""flawed study design"" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study ""statistical power"" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).[151]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia ""makes no guarantee of validity"" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[W 54] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information,[152] vandalism, and similar problems. Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a ""general source"" that ""can be a real boon"" in ""coming up to speed in the law governing a situation"" and, ""while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources"".[153]
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia."" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[154] Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, ""the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created"".[155] In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that: ""There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is]."" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopædia Britannica, summarizing that ""...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.""[156]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[157] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[158] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[159] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of ""fake news"" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[160]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.[70][W 55] In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[162] The article stated that: ""Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'""[162][163][164][165][166] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[167]
Some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[168] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[169][170] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[171] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. ""For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia"", he said.[172][173]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[174] In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything"".[175]
A 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education ""flipped classroom"", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.[176]
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled ""Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia"", stated that ""Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.""[177] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.[177] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled ""Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?"", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: ""Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.""[178] Beck added that: ""Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.""[178]
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[W 56] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[179][180] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[W 57] The ""Wikipedia is not censored"" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.[181] The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[182] and Pakistan,[183] among other countries.[184][185][186]
Through its ""Wikipedia Loves Libraries"" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[187] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the ""people and arts"" category, while males focus more on ""geography and science"".[188]
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.[189] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.[190]
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.[191] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.[123]
Academic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the ""average Wikipedian"", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15–49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[192] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[193][194] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[195][196] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[193]
Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.[195] In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example ""biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare"".[37] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[38]
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.[197] Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.[W 58] The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.[W 59]
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a ""blacklist"" it supplies to British internet service providers.[198]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[199][200] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted ""obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children"", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[201] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[201] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[202]
Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[203] saying that Wikipedia did not have ""material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.""[203] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".[204] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[205]
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a ""private citizen"" rather than a ""public figure"" in the eyes of the law.[206][g] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, ""we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement"", and states that ""personal information"" may be shared ""For legal reasons"", ""To Protect You, Ourselves & Others"", or ""To Understand & Experiment"".[W 60]
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka ""Tron"", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.[207]
Wikipedia has a "" Volunteer Response Team"" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS[W 61] to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.[W 62]
In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.[208]
Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.[209][210] The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.[211] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[212]
In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media.[W 63][213] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics ""for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics"", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[213][214] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard Mourou.[213] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that ""it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.""[215] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[215]
A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. ""Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.""[216]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.[W 64] The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[217][W 65] The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.[W 66]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[W 67] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, ""Information, like air, wants to be free.""[218][219] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who ""said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities"", Walsh said.[218]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the ""superprotection"" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,[W 68] Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[W 69] Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: ""It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.""[122]
Maher served as executive director until April 2021.[220] Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.[221]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.[W 70]
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.[W 71] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.[W 72] MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.[W 71][W 73] Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.[W 74] Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[W 75] In April 2005, a Lucene extension[W 76][W 77] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch.[W 78] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[222][223][224] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as ""slow and buggy"".[225] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[W 79]
Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[W 80][226][227] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[228] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[W 81] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[226] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[229] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[W 82] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[230]
As of 2021,[update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server.[W 83] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.[W 83] The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.[231]
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system.[W 84] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.[W 85][232] In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[W 86] In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France.[W 87] As of February 2023,[update] caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore, and Marseille.[W 25][W 88]
Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[38] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[233] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the ""Thank"" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[38][225] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[234] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,[W 89] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[234] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,[W 90] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[234]
Multiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.[235][236] The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects.[W 91]
The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.[237][238] Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said ""By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.""[239]
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[W 24] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.[240] In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[W 92] Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.[W 93] In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[W 94][W 95][W 96][W 97]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine,[W 98] while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.[W 99] Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[241] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.[242][243]
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.[W 100] The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.
Thousands of ""mirror sites"" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com.[244][245] Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.[W 101] Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset)[246] and DuckDuckGo.
Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.[W 102] The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,[W 103] the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,[W 104] and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.[W 105] Additionally, ""Wikipedia for Schools"", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.[W 106]
There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[247][W 107] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.[248]
The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.[249] Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF.[W 108] As of February 2023,[update] it has over 101 million items.[W 109] WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.[W 110]
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[W 111] Wikipedia publishes ""dumps"" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,[update] there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[W 112] Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this.[250]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[251]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, ""Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."" In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned ""a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile"", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the ""worry"" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[45] By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.[7]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.[W 101] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices.[W 113] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.[252][253]
The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[W 114][W 115] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[W 116] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[W 117][254] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[W 117]
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[255][256] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[255] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[38] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[255][256]
Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015.[16][257][258] This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.[259]
In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[13][14] Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, ""YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.""[14][260]
In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating ""With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.""[45] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[261] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[262]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[W 118] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[263] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[W 119] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[264] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[265]
According to ""Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011"", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[W 120] As of February 2023,[update] Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.[W 1]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[266][267][268][269] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, ""Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.""[267] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.[270] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.[update][271][272]
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[W 121][273][274] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the ""related links"" section of its ""further reading"" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[275] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[276]—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[277] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[278] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[279] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[280][281] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[282][283][284][285]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[286] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: ""Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.""[287] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled ""Wikipedia page the latest status symbol"", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[288]
One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, ""the seventh most consulted website"", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[289]
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia ""the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth"".[290][291]
In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as ""one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web"" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having ""since colonized the web for television's values"". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers ""endangered"" due to the ""gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment"". Rather than ""sapere aude"" (lit. 'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of ""dare not to care to know"". This is while Wikipedia faces ""a more concerning problem"" than funding, namely ""a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website"". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to ""save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.""[292]
Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[W 122] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the ""community"" category.[293]
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question ""Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?""[294]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.[295]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[296] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.[297] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.[298]
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning ""together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on"".[167] Another example can be found in ""Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence"", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[299] as well as the 2010 The Onion article ""'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today"".[300]
In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[301] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[302]
""My Number One Doctor"", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.[303]
In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named ""Professor Wikipedia"", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[304] The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying ""Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.""[305] In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[306] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[307]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: ""Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?""[308] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.[309]
In June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title ""Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday"" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level.[310]
Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[W 123] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,[311] Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,[W 124] Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,[W 125] Wikinews, for collaborative journalism,[W 126] and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[W 127] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing.[312] In 2012, Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide,[313] and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.[W 128]
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[314][315][316] Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay ""The amorality of Web 2.0"" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because ""free trumps quality all the time"". Carr wrote, ""Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.""[317] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the ""wisdom of crowds"" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.[318]
Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping ""far more sharply"".[319] Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, ""The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?""[319]
Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing.[320][321] In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called ""wikification"",[322] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.[323] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find ""missing"" links in Wikipedia.[324]
In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[325][326][327] They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms ""followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)"".[327][328] The study was updated in 2019.[329]
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia ""at least a dozen times a day"", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as ""a work of reference as useful as any in existence"", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[330]
A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[331][332] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence[291] to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism[333][334] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.[335][336]
In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.[337]
Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[338]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[339] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[W 129] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[340]
Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium.[341][342] The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[343][344]

^ Sanger, Larry (December 31, 2004). ""Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism"". Kuro5hin, Op–Ed. Archived from the original on November 1, 2021. Retrieved March 26, 2021. There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry ""censorship"", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.)

Harris and Trump Battle to the Wire in Swing States, Times/Siena Polls Find
Donald Trump has improved his standing in Pennsylvania even as late-deciding voters appear to be breaking for Kamala Harris.

Some Surprises in Last Battleground Polls, but Still Pointing to Deadlock
The race remains essentially even across the seven states likeliest to decide the presidency.

A Deeper Look at the Numbers
Ruth Igielnik
The gender gap continues to be massive this election. Harris is winning women by 16 percentage points in battleground states while Trump wins men by the same margin. For the first time, abortion is the most important issue for women in deciding their vote. For men, the economy is the top concern.
Ruth Igielnik
Harris is winning young voters by 17 percentage points in battleground states. That is a substantial improvement over Joe Biden’s standing with young voters earlier this year. But Harris still slightly lags Biden’s 2020 numbers with young voters, many of whom are struggling to decide up until the end.
Lisa Lerer
There are still voters to be persuaded, even at this late hour in the race. The poll shows that 11 percent of voters remained undecided, down from 16 percent about a month ago.
Ruth Igielnik
The poll finds that in some states nearly half of voters have already voted. Harris is winning those voters in six of the seven states, while Trump is winning them in Arizona.
Ruth Igielnik
All eyes are on Pennsylvania, where Trump and Harris are deadlocked. The last three Times/Siena polls had Harris +4 in the state, suggesting the race has narrowed significantly in the state that might be key to victory for either candidate.
Maya King
Harris has a slight edge over Trump in Georgia. Her campaign has invested millions in the state in the hopes of building on Biden’s narrow 2020 win in the state. Harris rallied thousands near downtown Atlanta yesterday.
Katie Glueck
Harris and Trump are deadlocked in Michigan, a crucial battleground state that Biden won in 2020 and Trump won in 2016. Harris is campaigning in Michigan today, while Trump has a rally scheduled in Grand Rapids tomorrow night.
Jennifer Medina
Harris is narrowly ahead of Trump in Nevada. Democrats have been anxiously analyzing early voting patterns in the state and are now relying on a heavy turnout in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the majority of the state’s Democrats.
Jonathan Swan
The final batch of public polls has set off a round of late second-guessing among some Trump allies. But Trump’s core team remains convinced that these public polls are underestimating his support and that he is on track to win.

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that’s taken the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch or Adobe Illustrator, which are standalone applications, Figma can be run entirely from a web browser and, therefore, works not only on Macs but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. It's also free to use!
Another big advantage of Figma is that it allows real-time collaboration on the same file. When using conventional “offline” apps like Sketch and Illustrator, if designers want to share their work, they typically have to export it to an image file and then send it via email or instant message.
In Figma, instead of exporting static images, we can simply share a link to the Figma file for clients and colleagues to open in their browsers. This in itself saves significant time and can streamline a designer’s workflow. But more importantly, it means that clients and colleagues can interact more richly with the work and review the latest version of the file.
This course aims to introduce all of the key functions in Figma. We’ll achieve that by building a set of app screens together. We’ll also use Figma’s prototyping functionality to link the screens together, meaning you can experience how the screens will behave like they would if this were a functional app ready for people to download and use. You’ll be able to share your prototypes with friends, or develop your design further and add it to your portfolio!
Before we get started with today’s lesson, take a sec to work through our quick one-minute goal setting exercise. We want to make sure you’re getting the most out of this course... and that by the end of it you’ve mastered the basics of Figma and accomplished any personal learning goals!
Time to complete: 30 minutes
Getting started in Figma is as simple as going to www.figma.com, clicking “Get started”, entering your details, and completing a quick verification activity. Once you’ve done that, Figma will guide you to a screen with a few more onboarding questions before throwing you right into a project file with some examples of what you can create using Figma .
The look and feel of the Figma interface is quite minimal, but it belies a set of powerful features. Here’s an explanation of the interface’s main areas (labeled above):
Unlike regular desktop design apps, Figma’s menu can be found by clicking the Figma logo in the top-left of the screen. Take a minute to browse around this dropdown and see what’s there! Here, you can also search for specific commands you need. Click on the magnifying glass where it says “Quick actions…” and type in “rectangle” and you’ll quickly find the Rectangle Tool, complete with a handy reminder of its keyboard shortcut (it’s [[R]], by the way).
Here you can quickly access the tools you’re likely to use most often: move, frame, shapes, pen, text, etc. (We’ll cover these tools in the next couple of days!)
This area shows extra options for whatever object you have selected on your canvas. When no object is selected (as shown above), Figma displays the file name.
The right side of the toolbar is where you can find the file sharing functions and see who else is viewing your file in real-time. You’ll also find view and zoom options.
Also known simply as the “left sidebar,” this is where every element in the file is listed and organized into Pages, Frames and Groups.
‍This is where you’ll create all of your designs!
The properties panel offers contextual information and settings for whatever object is selected. In the image above, we’re seeing options for the Canvas itself. By default, you’re viewing the Design tab, but there is also a separate tab for setting up a Prototype —we’ll cover this later in the week.
Now that you’ve found your way around, let’s start making stuff! Let’s start a new project by clicking the Menu button (Figma’s logo) in the top left corner and then selecting File and “New design file.” Doing this should automatically create a new file with an empty canvas in a new tab on your browser.
In Figma, a Frame is essentially a container for other elements. If you’ve used Sketch or Adobe Illustrator before, it functions in the same way as an Artboard. Press [[F]] to select the Frame Tool. Alternatively, you can click the Frame tool icon in the toolbar at the top of the window. Equally, if you’re used to Sketch, you can also hit [[A]] (for “Artboard”).
Note that we’ll often refer to keyboard shortcuts in these tutorials. It’s worth getting in the habit of using these shortcuts because they’ll significantly speed up your workflow further down the line. In the short videos through this course, you’ll see the keystrokes we use on Mac computers.
There are a couple of ways of creating a Frame. We can either click and drag in the canvas area, or we can select a pre-set Frame size from the Properties panel on the right hand side of the window. We chose the iPhone SE template. Try both ways now!
You’ll probably find yourself wanting to zoom in and out quite a bit in Figma, particularly once we start working with multiple Frames. The standard zoom commands are accessed with [[⌘]][[+]] and [[⌘]][[-]]. Try it now!
Those commands will just focus in on the center of your current view. But there are some other handy zoom commands available:
Select the Frame by clicking on its name, then try alternating these commands to switch between the selection and the whole canvas.
Finally, here’s an *extra* handy zoom tip to move between Frames without having to zoom in and out the whole time:
Another useful tool, particularly when you’re zoomed in close or working on a large file, is the Hand tool. Try pressing and holding the [[Spacebar]] on your keyboard and you’ll see a hand icon pop up. Click and drag to move the whole canvas around. If you’re working with a Mac trackpad, you can do the same by dragging on the trackpad with two fingers.
Next, let’s create some text. Press [[T]] to select the Text tool, and click anywhere within your iPhone SE frame to create a Text layer. This is going to be part of a button design, so let’s type “Sign In”. Hit [[Escape]] to exit the Text tool.
Press [[R]] to select the Rectangle tool. Drag a button-shaped rectangle around the text you just created.
Currently, the text is hidden underneath the rectangle. To fix this, we need to use Figma’s “Arrange” commands. Head over to the Layers panel on the left of the window. Select the “Sign In” text layer, then right-click (PC/Mac) or ctrl-click (Mac) to bring up a list of options. Click “Bring to front”, and the text will now be placed on top of the rectangle.
You can also access Arrange tools using keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
PC:
This being a button, we want the text and rectangle shapes to be centered relative to one another. Figma has a set of “Align” commands that allow us to do this. Make sure that the Move tool is selected by pressing [[Escape]], or [[V]], and then drag a “marquee” (a rectangular selection) around the text and the rectangle.
We can access the Align commands in the Properties (the interface area to the right of the window). Click “Align Horizontal Centers” and “Align Vertical Centers” to get the two objects nicely lined up.
Select the rectangle shape you just created. In the Properties panel, there is a setting called “Corner Radius”, which allows us to make the corners of any shape rounded. Here, type in the number of pixels you want each corner to be rounded by.
To max out the corners and create semi-circles at each end of the rectangle, just enter a number larger than half the object height. (We set ours to 32 so that we’re covered in case we want to make the button a bit bigger later on—but try out some different numbers and see what happens!)
The color settings can also be found in the Properties panel. We often want to attract people’s attention with buttons—so select the rectangle, and pick a bright color! We’ve gone with a bright yellow by typing in a hex code (#EEEE33)—but you can also click to open the color palette, and pick a color that way.
With the text layer selected, you can access settings in the Properties panel to change the font, as well as font size, weight, and color. We’ve stuck with Inter, but switched up to bold and uppercase text. We also aligned the text to center. Try exploring the options!
That brings us to the end of Day 1 of Figma 101! We’ve found our way around the interface, tried out a few basic tools, and created a button that we’ll be able to use in our app.
The final thing to do for today is to give our file a name—to do this, just deselect all objects ([[Escape]] will do the trick), and click where it says “Untitled” at the top of the window. Then type something like “Figma 101 App”. That’s it! Figma stores all your files in the cloud.
See you again tomorrow, when we’ll be creating our first app screen.
Create a login screen for your app.

Paragraphs:
Fake news refers to false or misleading information which masquerades as legitimate news. Generally, fake news falls into two categories:
Misinformation isn’t a new phenomenon – the term “fake news” was actually used in the 19th century – but the internet and soI don’cial media have transformed how it’s created and spread. Pre-internet, people tended to receive their news from trusted media sources whose journalists were required to follow strict codes of practice. The internet enabled new ways to publish, share and consume news and information, with relatively little regulation or editorial standards. Many people now consume news from social media and other online sources – but it’s not always easy to determine which stories are credible and which are false.
There are different types of fake news, depending on the motivation of those who create it. For example:
Sensationalism sells, and outrageous or weird stories and distorted images drive clicks and shares online. Clickbait refers to stories deliberately designed to get more website visitors and increase advertising revenue for the website owners – often at the expense of truth and accuracy.
This refers to false or distorted stories written to mislead audiences and promote a political agenda or biased perspective.
Sometimes, journalists don’t have time to check all their facts before publishing, leading to genuine mistakes becoming fake news. However, trusted new sources will correct errors in their stories and be transparent with readers when they’ve got things wrong.
Sometimes a story may be broadly true, but a sensationalist or misleading headline is used to entice readers to click on it. This can lead to fake news – since usually only the headline and small snippets of the article are displayed on social media, where it can quickly spread.
This is when genuine news sources are impersonated with false, made-up stories to deceive or mislead audiences.
Some fake news is published for entertainment value. For example, satirical stories use humor, irony, or exaggeration to joke about the news or famous people. These stories don't attempt to mislead audiences because they aren't meant to be taken seriously. Notable examples of satirical websites include The Onion and The Daily Mash.
High-profile politicians have been known to dismiss stories they disagree with – which may be factual and verified – as “fake news”. Because the term “fake news” is expansive and means different things to different people, it can be contested. In 2018, the British Government banned the term from official papers or documents, claiming it was too poorly defined to be meaningful. Instead, it prefers to use the terms ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation"" when describing false stories:
Fake news is often spread through fake news websites, which, in an attempt to gain credibility, often emulate authentic news sources. According to research, social media enables false claims to spread quickly – more quickly, in fact, than real news. Fake news spreads rapidly because it’s typically designed to grab attention and appeal to emotions – which is why it often features outlandish claims or stories which provoke anger or fear.
Social media feeds often prioritize content based on engagement metrics – that is, how often it’s shared and liked – rather than how accurate or well-researched it is. This approach can allow clickbait, hyperbole, and misinformation to spread widely. Social media companies are seen as platforms rather than publishers, which means they don’t have the same legal liabilities as traditional media outlets – although this may change as the political and legal landscape evolves.
Social media bots can spread fake news since they mass produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of their sources. Bots can create fake accounts online, which then gain followers, recognition, and authority – some of which are programmed to spread misinformation.
Trolls – internet users who deliberately try to start arguments or upset people – also play a part in spreading fake news. Sometimes they can be paid to do so for political reasons. The terms “troll farm” or “troll factory” are sometimes used in this context to refer to institutionalized groups of trolls who attempt to interfere in political decision-making.
Fake news sometimes involves the use of Deepfakes. These are fake videos created using digital software, machine learning, and face-swapping. Images are combined to create new footage which shows events or actions that never actually took place. The results can be very convincing and difficult to identify as false.
Coronavirus fake news
The Covid-19 pandemic provided fertile ground for false information online, with numerous examples of fake news throughout the crisis. A persistent example of fake news in social media was the claim that 5G technology was linked to the spread of the virus – supposedly because 5G suppressed the immune system while the virus communicated through radio waves. These claims were not true and were repeatedly debunked by official sources but were still shared extensively.
US presidential election in 2016
Fake news and misinformation became a big issue during the US election in 2016, with false and misleading claims across the political spectrum. One analysis suggested that a large proportion of fake news generated in the election was created by teenagers in Macedonia, who found the more hyper-partisan stories they created, the more people clicked through and shared, and the more money they made as a result.
Boston Marathon bombing
In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, false claims that the bombing was an elaborate ruse plotted by the US government circulated online. In the wake of many terrorist events across the world, conspiracy theories are often rife. The notion that they are ""false flag"" operations – i.e., carried out by the state or a secret cabal to pin the blame on others or provide cover for other activities – is a common trope.
Kim Jong-un – the sexiest man alive?
In 2012, satirical website The Onion ran an article claiming that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un had been voted the sexiest man alive, declaring that ""the Pyongyang-bred heartthrob is every woman's dream come true."" In an example of how satire can sometimes be misunderstood across cultures, publications in China – including the online version of China's Communist Party newspaper – reported the claim as though it were true.
People often make important decisions – for example, how to vote in an election or what medical treatment to follow when they’re ill – based on what they read in the news. That’s why trusted news is so important. The dangers of fake news include:
You may be wondering how to identify fake news on Facebook and other social media sites? As a student, how to avoid fake news? Or how to avoid accidentally sharing misinformation online? Here are ten tips to identify misinformation, recognize fake news websites, and think before you share:
1. Check the source:
Check the web address for the page you're looking at. Sometimes, fake news sites may have spelling errors in the URL or use less conventional domain extensions such as "".infonet"" or "".offer"". If you are unfamiliar with the site, look in the About Us section.
2. Check the author:
Research them to see if they are credible – for example, are they real, do they have a good reputation, are they writing about their specific area of expertise, and do they have a particular agenda? Consider what the writer’s motivation might be.
3. Check other sources:
Are other reputable news or media outlets reporting on the story? Are credible sources cited within the story? Professional global news agencies have editorial guidelines and extensive resources for fact-checking, so if they are also reporting the story, that’s a good sign.
4. Maintain a critical mindset:
A lot of fake news is cleverly written to provoke strong emotional reactions such as fear or anger. Maintain a critical mindset by asking yourself – why has this story been written? Is it promoting a particular cause or agenda? Is it trying to make me click through to another website?
5. Check the facts:
Credible news stories will include plenty of facts – data, statistics, quotes from experts, and so on. If these are missing, question why. Reports with false information often contain incorrect dates or altered timelines, so it’s a good idea to check when the article was published. Is it a current or old news story?
6. Check the comments:
Even if the article or video is legitimate, the comments below may not be. Often links or comments posted in response to content can be autogenerated by bots or people hired to put our misleading or confusing information.
7. Check your own biases:
We all have biases – could these be influencing the way you respond to the article? Social media can create echo chambers by suggesting stories that match your existing browsing habits, interests, and opinions. The more we read from diverse sources and perspectives, the more likely it is that we can draw accurate conclusions.
8. Check whether it’s a joke:
Satirical websites are popular, and sometimes it is not always clear whether a story is just a joke or parody. Check the website to see if it’s known for satire or creating funny stories.
9. Check images are authentic:
Images you see on social media could have been edited or manipulated. Possible signs include warping – where straight lines in the background now appear wavy – as well as strange shadows, jagged edges, or skin tone that looks too perfect. Bear in mind, too, that an image may be accurate but simply used in a misleading context. You can use tools such as Google’s Reverse Image Search to check where an image originates from and whether it has been altered.
10. Use a fact-checking site:
Some of the best known include:
Fake news relies on believers reposting, retweeting, or otherwise sharing false information. If you're not sure whether an article is authentic or not, pause and think before you share. To help stay safe online, use an antivirus solution like Kaspersky Total Security, which protects you from hackers, viruses, malware, and other online threats.

Deliberately inaccurate stories – that is, the people publishing them know them to be false but publish them anyway. This might be to manipulate public opinion or to drive traffic to a specific website.
Stories that contain elements of truth but are broadly inaccurate. This might be because the writer hasn’t checked all their facts or has exaggerated certain aspects to make a particular point.
Disinformation– fake or misleading stories created and shared deliberately, often by a writer who might have a financial or political motive to do so.
Misinformation – this also means fake or misleading stories, but in this case, the stories may not have been deliberately created or shared with the intention to mislead.
When people can’t distinguish between real and fake news, it creates confusion and misunderstanding about important social and political issues. When people have a generalized sense of ""you can't believe anything you read,"" it undermines overall trust in legitimate news sources.
Fake and misleading stories relating to medical treatments or major diseases – such as cancer or Covid-19 – could lead to individuals making misinformed decisions about their health.
A lot of fake news is designed to stir up and intensify social conflict. When different sides of an argument have their own ‘facts’, it leads to greater polarization within societies and can affect electoral outcomes.
Universities and colleges expect students to use quality sources of information for assignments. Students who use sources with false or misleading information could receive lower grades.

UPDATED Nov. 3, 2024, at 8:36 AM

We adjust polls for house effects, mode, partisanship, voter likelihood and third parties and weight them based on their firm’s 538 pollster rating and how often it polls.
LAST UPDATED Nov. 1
Now that we are in the closing days of the 2024 presidential race, pollsters have started releasing their final readings of the campaign. They have mostly been a mixed bag. On Friday, Marist College released their highly-anticipated final polls across the Midwestern states, finding Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump by 3 points in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and 2 points in Wisconsin. That would be good news for Harris if those were the only polls released this week, but they weren’t: An Echelon Insights survey found Trump up 5 points in the Keystone State, and CNN/SSRS has the former president up by 1 in Georgia. In aggregate, this has been enough to push our model modestly back in Harris’s direction. Currently, our forecast gives Trump a XXX out of 100 chance of winning the election, and gives Harris a XXX out of 100 chance.
Still, the closeness of the race bears repeating what has become something of a mantra here at 538 recently: A close race in the polls does not necessarily mean the outcome will be close. All seven swing states are still within a normal polling error of going to the candidate who is currently “losing”in each. While the polls have identified a close race, our model shows what you should expect if those polls are off.
538’s forecast is based on a combination of polls and campaign “fundamentals,” such as economic conditions, state partisanship and incumbency. It’s not meant to “call” a winner, but rather to give you a sense of how likely each candidate is to win. Check out our methodology to learn exactly how we calculate these probabilities.
—G. Elliott Morris
The forecast updates at least once a day and whenever we get new data. Uncertainty will decrease as we get closer to Election Day.
We forecast the popular vote only for candidates polling at 5 percent or higher nationally, polling at 10 percent or higher in at least one state or who are on the ballot in almost every state. Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s withdrawal, only Harris and Trump meet these criteria, so we are effectively forecasting the two-way popular vote between Democrats and Republicans.
Number of electoral votes and the probability of a Democratic or Republican win in each state. Outlined states are most likely to give the winner their 270th Electoral College vote.
Use the table below to sort states by name, forecasted margin of victory or two different metrics of how much influence they have over the outcome.
A state’s tipping-point chance is the probability it will give the Electoral College winner their 270th electoral vote. The Voter Power Index (VPI) is a relative measure of how likely an individual voter in that state is to determine the outcome of the election.
A state’s tipping-point chance is the probability it will give the Electoral College winner their 270th electoral vote. The Voter Power Index (VPI) is a relative measure of how likely an individual voter in that state is to determine the outcome of the election.
Our “snake” chart orders the states by forecasted margin of victory. Scroll to the left or right to see uncompetitive states; more contested states are in the middle. Bigger segments mean more Electoral College votes.
This graph shows the national popular vote margin and Electoral College margin in every model simulation. It shows you how often a candidate wins the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.
Our forecast is based on a combination of the polls and various economic and political variables we call the “fundamentals.” This chart shows how we get from the polls today to a forecast for Election Day.
The state of public opinion today, according only to 538’s average of national polls.
The national polling average adjusted for results of state polls and the effects of party conventions.
The adjusted polling average with uncertainty intervals that account for potential movement in the race between now and Election Day. This does not account for the chance that the polls systematically underestimate one candidate.

What our fundamentals model alone would predict the popular vote margin to be.

Our final forecast of the popular vote, based on a weighted average of the polls and fundamentals using the weights above. This accounts for the chance that the polls systematically underestimate one candidate.
Forecast components may not exactly add up to full forecast because of rounding and random sampling. (When combining the components, we take a random sample of simulations from each, and they may not exactly match the full sample of simulations.)

Im overwhelmed by the amount of resources there are out there. Some says to learn the subject other to learn tool, some both, ahh so much chores, that i decided to learn the tool but now again there are tons of resources. docs, tutorial, project. am i doing wrong my learning through project? like without understanding spacing,color etc just copying pasting or trying my own idea to do that in figma then learn lets say for that project i required to use gradient so i searched all the way to learn then back to project repeat the process till my project is done.

Am i doing wrong by learning through this method. i feel like i am wasting time by first understanding tool one by one then at last building project for example what is frame and its propetries then at the time of building i dont really remember what i watched or read
Should i switch to my old method of learning through project? whether its fancy project that i know isnt appicable in real life till making cuz its seems interesting not caring much about perfect spacing and guidelines for now, what do you think?

While the overall result of our final Times/Siena polls is largely unchanged since our previous wave of battleground polls, there were some notable shifts. Surprisingly, the longstanding gap between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt battlegrounds narrowed considerably. The overall effect of these swings is somewhat contradictory — Harris’s position in the Electoral College isn’t necessarily improved. Updated Nov. 3

While the overall result of our final Times/Siena polls is largely unchanged since our previous wave of battleground polls, there were some notable shifts. Surprisingly, the longstanding gap between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt battlegrounds narrowed considerably. The overall effect of these swings is somewhat contradictory — Harris’s position in the Electoral College isn’t necessarily improved. Updated Nov. 3
Both Trump and Harris have states they can probably count on to get at least 200 electoral votes, but they need to get to 270 to win. Let’s zoom in on seven key states in the middle where the vote was closest in 2020.
Harris 251
Trump 268
If the polls miss in Trump’s favor Trump could win if the polls are underestimating him even slightly. In 2016 and 2020, he outperformed the polls in the swing states, and he could do it again. Here’s one possibility.
Harris 226
Trump 312
If the polls miss in Harris’s favor Harris could easily prevail if the polls are underestimating her. For example, state polls underestimated Democrats in the 2022 midterms, and they could also miss in that direction this year. Here’s a possible scenario.
Harris 292
Trump 246
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Across the seven swing states that are likely to decide the outcome of this election, the polls are so remarkably close that neither candidate has a meaningful edge in this final stretch. But if the polls are off even by a small margin, it’s possible either candidate could sweep most or all of these states. You can explore all possible scenarios and see the potential paths to victory here. Updated Oct. 23
States are shown in order of the closest current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
We now have enough polls to generate an average in Iowa, after a new poll from the well-regarded pollster J. Ann Selzer. That poll finds Harris up three percentage points. Our average has Trump ahead by 2 percentage points, which puts it in line with the core battleground states. Updated Nov. 2
It’s normal for polls not to match the final results, sometimes by considerable amounts. The ranges in this chart represent the magnitude of each state’s biggest polling miss in recent elections, shown in relation to the current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
In 2016 and 2020, the polls underestimated Trump. But in 2012 they underestimated the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and in 2022 Democrats outperformed polling averages in several key midterm races. Past polling misses can give a sense of the magnitude by which current averages could be wrong, but they are not a guarantee of which way today’s polls may be off.
Every poll here influences the averages above. Polls from “select pollsters,” which meet certain criteria for reliability, count for more and are shown with a diamond. You can filter by state and toggle to show only select pollsters.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Polls by “select pollsters” are shown with a diamond. These pollsters have backgrounds that tend to mean they are more reliable. Also, polls that were conducted by or for partisan organizations are labeled, as they often release only results that are favorable to their cause.
Arrows to the left indicate polling gains for Harris; to the right, for Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Even as Trump has gained over the last few weeks, the battleground states remain extraordinarily tight. With the race so close, it wouldn’t take much of a polling error to yield a different outcome. The polls are never exactly right; if they err one way or another by a point or two, as usual, then either side could win by a decisive margin. Updated Oct. 31
This chart shows how the polling margin has changed over the course of the campaign, first for the Biden vs. Trump matchup, and now for Harris vs. Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Nationwide, Harris now has her smallest lead in our average since the Democratic convention. Most of the major national polls have showed a shift toward Trump since their prior surveys. The size of his gains shouldn’t be overstated — we’re talking about a point or so — but it has nonetheless been enough to make the race more or less truly tied. Whatever edge Harris might have had has vanished. Updated Oct. 23
About our polling averages
Our averages include polls collected by The New York Times and by FiveThirtyEight. The estimates adjust for a variety of factors, including the recency and sample size of a poll, whether a poll represents likely voters, and whether other polls have shifted since a poll was conducted.
We also evaluate whether each pollster: Has a track record of accuracy in recent electionsIs a member of a professional polling organizationConducts probability-based sampling
These elements factor into how much weight each poll gets in the average. And we consider pollsters that meet at least two of the three criteria to be “select pollsters,” so long as they are conducting polls for nonpartisan sponsors. Read more about our methodology.
The Times conducts its own national and state polls in partnership with Siena College. Those polls are included in the averages. Follow Times/Siena polling here.
Maine and Nebraska award two electoral votes to the statewide winner and a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. (Maine has two congressional districts, and Nebraska has three.) Historical election results for these districts are calculated based on votes cast within the current boundaries of the district.

Every artist needs an artboard, brush, palette, paint, and a vision to create the beautiful art we all love.
…or, in some cases, have no choice but to love.

Like artists, designers also require specific tools to create engaging design systems people can interact with.
One that you’ve probably heard of is Figma – a cloud-based design tool.
Let’s cut to the chase!
To get started on Figma, you need to have an account. So, let’s open one together.
First, go to www.figma.com and click the Get Started button at the top right corner to sign up. If you have an account with them already, click the Log in button instead.

Since this is a tutorial, we’ll go with the sign-up option. For that, Figma gives you two choices.

Click the Continue with Google button or enter your email and preferred password. You’ll also be asked to input your name, specify the kind of work you do, and how you intend to use Figma.
Then, click the Create account button. You’ll be sent a verification email almost immediately. Open the message and tap Verify email, and you’re all set.
Now, you should have access to a dashboard that looks like this:

Creating new projects
To create projects in Figma, you must be part of a team. If you already are, just join them and open their file browser. But if you don’t, click the Create new team button on the left side of the page and enter a team name. Then invite collaborators you’d like to work with you on the project.

After you’ve created a team, you’ll be taken to the team’s page. From there, you can create a new project.
So let’s do that!
Click on the New project button on the top right side of your team’s file page. Enter a name for the project if you’re on Figma’s Pro plan or select the Team project box to proceed if you’re on the free plan.

Voila! You’ve created a new project.
You can only create one project and three designs with the Free plan. But with the Pro plan, you can access unlimited projects and designs.
Adding a design file
Design files house the design you want to work on, and they can be added to the project’s environment.

Just tap the New design file button, and you’ll be redirected to a new page that shows the Figma file like this. 👇

You can give your design file a name when you first create it. The default name is ‘Untitled,’ but you can tap on it to change it, so it’s more descriptive.
Explore Figma templates
Figma has a database of templates you can customize for your UX designs. To access them, head back to the project folder and select See all. It’s just under the New Design button you clicked on earlier.

Now that your Figma account is set up let’s start creating new frames for your design.
Frames are like boards on Figma. They represent the interface end users of the design will interact with. You can select different frames on Figma in which to place your design.
To create new frames, open the design file and click the Frame tool in the top left-hand corner. Having trouble finding it? Look for the button that looks like a hashtag. You can also create new frames by pressing the letter F on your keyboard.

Choosing a frame size
Once you’ve selected the frame tool, go to the left side of the page. Pick a frame from the selections available, and it’ll appear on the canvas. Available frame sizes include most iPhones and Androids.
For this tutorial, let’s select the Surface Pro 8 frame:

If you need a frame different from the ones available, you can draw your own by clicking and dragging the mouse.
Editing a frame’s properties
After selecting a frame, you’ll see a panel under Design on the right side of the page. There you can assign different properties to the frame as you see fit.
For example, you can change the frame size by typing in your desired pixel size in the X, Y, W, and H columns.
Other things you can do include filling the frame with color using Fill, adding effects by clicking Effects, and more.
Using layers
On the left side of the screen is the Layers panel. Each time you add a new element or frame, a new layer is added. You can rearrange them by dragging and dropping them.
You can also group layers to have a more organized file if you want to move them across different frames. To group layers, select all the elements. Press Ctrl+G if you’re a Windows user or CMD+G on a Mac.
Vector shapes
If you want to use basic shapes (rectangle, circle, etc.), pick the square sign from the top of the page.
For more complex shapes, icons, logos, or buttons, select the pen icon from the top menu or press P on your keyboard.

With it, you can click anywhere on the frame to create the kind of shape you have in mind. Then, press Enter when you’re done.
If you want to modify the vector shape when designing, you can do so via the Properties menu on the right-hand side of the page.
What’s a design without pictures? Here’s how you add them on Figma!
There are different ways to insert images into your frame on Figma. The most popular and simplest way is to drag and drop them into your work area.
You can also click the Shape menu at the top of the page and select Place image/video.

When you click Open, a dialogue box will open, where you can select the images you want to use. Then, click OK to insert the pictures.
Alternatively, press CMD+Shift+K or Ctrl+Shift+K, to open the dialogue box.
If the image you want to use is from another place on Figma, select the image and press CMD+C or Ctrl+C. Head over to the frame you want to use and press CMD+V or Ctrl+V.
But what if you want to insert the image into a different shape or frame?
To do that, click on the frame. Select Fill from the Properties menu on the right side of the work area if you want to add color.
You’ll see a drop-down menu at the top-left of the color wheel: click it and select Image or Videos.

To choose an image, hover your cursor on the smaller window with black and white colors and click Choose Image.

A dialogue box will pop up so you can pick the images you want. Click Open to insert them into the shape or frame.
If you want, you can edit the picture with the different parameters shown in the small window.
To insert objects, click the square shape icon from the top menu to draw polygons, stars, arrows, lines, rectangles, and ellipses.

Select any shape, click on the frame, and drag it to your preferred size. For a shape with equal proportions, press down the shift key while you draw.
Adding text on Figma is pretty straightforward too.
Just click the T sign and tap on where you want the text on the frame to draw a text box. Then, start typing.
To edit the text, click the text layer and double-click on the text to edit. You can also edit it from the Properties menu. There, you’ll be able to change the text’s color, font, and even edit the words in the content section.
Now, if you’re working on multiple design projects using Figma, wouldn’t it be great to have saved styles that you could simply add to each project?
To learn how to save styles, keep reading!
By saving your styles, you can avoid having to redo the same design process over and over again.

For example, if you want the text headings of your design to have the same font, color, and size, you can create a style and save it as a reusable H2 style.
Then, apply that style to the corresponding headings.
Here’s how to create a text style:
To use the style, select the text you want formatted and click on the style icon to select it.
Text isn’t the only style you can save. Aside from text, you can also save colors, grids, and even effects.
As we saw earlier, saved styles can help you reuse colors or effects in future projects. To do that, you’ll need to:
You can follow the same steps when adding the text style to text whenever you need to reuse the saved templates.
There’s just one tiny drawback with saving a style; it’ll only be available on the file you’re working on.
So, what if you wanna use the styles on other project files? You’ll have to publish it to your team library. Here’s how:

That’s about it for saving styles. This should help you save time when brainstorming, wireframing, or designing.
To further simplify this process, you might want to consider adding reusable components to your design workflow.
Don’t worry, we’ll unpack what it means and how to add them in the next section.
Components are collections of UI elements, objects, or layers that you can repeatedly use across your design. They make it easy to maintain a consistent design to update or scale your work without stress.
Let’s assume you’re working on web design and want the logo and name of the brand to appear across the site.
Those are different elements that you can reuse. You could add both to a component and title it ‘brand logo.’ Then, add it to other frames.
Follow these steps when adding components:
You’ll notice that both layers will be fused into a single layer with the new name: ‘Component 1.’ You can rename it by double-clicking on the name.
This refers to the use of iterations of the components in your design that are not in the initial component.
To create a component icon, click on the Assets panel, the tab next to the Layers menu on the left side of the page.
Select and drag the component’s name to the canvas, creating an instance. You can edit the component icon, which won’t reflect on the original.

Like styles, you can save components for other files or projects.
Click anywhere on the canvas and select the down arrow beside the file’s name at the top of the page.
From the drop-down menu, click Publish library and follow the on-screen instructions to publish the component to the team library.
This feature, however, is only available to Pro or Enterprise users.
Still, in simplifying your processes, there’s another thing you can do…
Auto layout is a function that lets you create a dynamic frame that expands or contracts when you change the content inside it.
This will help you avoid having to adjust the frame repeatedly. It also lets you see whether your design works in real life with a single click.
To begin, change layers to auto layouts:

As you change the content, the box automatically resizes.
Nested auto layouts
Figma also lets you nest auto layouts, meaning you can have a frame within a frame for a more attractive user interface or UI design.
To nest auto layouts, you should have multiple elements or objects you want to merge.
Select them, press shift+A, and you’ll have a nested auto layout.
It should include a parent frame and a child frame.
And that’s about it for auto layouts!
You know how you can take a car you plan on buying for a test drive?
Well, you can do the same for your interface design. But on Figma, it’s referred to as testing prototypes, which we unpack next.
Whether you’re designing a mobile app, landing page, or website, you can test the user experience of either project on Figma’s space in real-time. Testing will help you know what needs to be improved.
To start testing, head over to the Properties menu on the right side of the page. Click the Prototype tab at the top of the panel.
The first thing you’ll likely see is the option to select the device type you want to preview the design on.
If you already selected the device you were designing for when you created the frame, you won’t see that option.

To proceed, click the + sign beside Flow starting point.
It will place a Flow 1 text at the top left corner of the first frame to indicate that as the starting point of the design flow. If you don’t want the selected frame as the first point, right-click the frame’s name and pick Delete starting point.

After selecting the starting point, you must select a hotspot from the starting frame. A hotspot is an area or element users must click to be directed to the next page.
To pick a hotspot, hover over the desired element and see a blue circle by the edge.
When your mouse is directly on the circle, a plus sign will appear. Click and drag the hotspot (+) to connect it to the next screen. It should look like this:

After making the connection, you should see an Interaction details panel.
There you can choose an interaction type for the hotspot. For instance, select On tap if you want the user to tap the hotspot to go to the next page. You can also choose an animation from the menu to show the transition between both screens.
Now, you can make more connections by selecting a hotspot on the second screen that, when users tap it, will link back to the first screen.
When you’re done, you can preview the web or app design by clicking the Play button at the top right corner of the screen.
If you’re comfortable with the final designs, there’s only one step left: invite team members or other stakeholders to collaborate.
Sharing a project with your team, aka developer handoff, is easy on Figma. Just click the Share button at the top right corner of the page.

Then, enter the email of other users or collaborators you want to share it with.
A shortcut is just to copy the link and share it with stakeholders. If you go with this option, update the security setting to Anyone with the link.
***
And with that, we’ve come to the end of this tutorial.
Whew, that was a lot! But we’re confident that you’ve gained a lot from this guide.
Just one more thing, and we can call it a day.
So far, you’ve learned how to use Figma for designs, mockups, and as a prototyping tool.
What you need, in addition to that, is a more streamlined design process that can help you get clear contextual feedback on your visuals.
While Figma allows you to add comments, you can do much more with MarkUp.io.
More specifically, you can optimize reviews, implement feedback, and keep track of the comments as you resolve them.
There’ll also be less confusion for clients who probably won’t get the hang of the design tool you’re using. Feel free to claim a free 30-day trial with MarkUp.io to see for yourself.

I ended up giving it away to a new up coming Chef in the making. He loves it and is happy using it.
This is a wonderful little food processor for those who are single and do not need to prepare a big meal. My daughter saw it and she said when she needs to make a smaller portion she'll come borrow it.
This is wonderful!! It's great for me, as I only cook for 1, or 2 at the most. Fast, easy, and easy clean up!!
So glad I bought this. Just the right size. Use it more then I thought I would.
Remind me about upcoming Cuisinart shows.

Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Be sure to check the food frequently to prevent overprocessing.
If you overprocess, you are likely to get a watery paste instead of a fine chop.
Use the grind function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts.
Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You may have to operate the Mini-Prep Plus Processor for several seconds with some food to achieve the desired results.

Paragraphs:
With just two days left until Election Day, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are putting the bows on their presidential campaigns, wrapping up arguments in must-win states before their final test: Tuesday, Nov. 5.
The former president has rallies scheduled in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, while the vice president has planned multiple stops in Michigan.
Keep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage live from the campaign trail.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
The American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevents at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.
When reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has ""received a variety of policy ideas"" but ""is focused on Tuesday’s election.""
But in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said ""Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,"" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.
– Karissa Waddick
Donald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he ""shouldn't have left"" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.
As Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd, ""we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” adding ""I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.""
Trump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.
− Marina Pitofsky
As voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.
Lichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Silver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his “gut” tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.
− Karissa Waddick
Visiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.
Vance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.
“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.

Kamala Harris followed her guest appearance on Saturday Night Live by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.
Harris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”
Americans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”
The country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5, “we are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
“Morning is on its way,” she said.
–Michael Collins
It is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.
But you can anticipate delays.
Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.
– Sudiksha Kochi and Sam Woodward
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.
For example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris 17-point advantage among women.
Stefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”
She also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better of under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, childcare was affordable,” Stefanik said.
It was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.

Talking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.
“I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news,” right?” Trump said to laughs from the crowd.
“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.
– Karissa Waddick
The former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.
""The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,"" Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.
Trump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.
""We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,"" Trump said. ""And fake polls.""
– David Jackson
Donald Trump at rally in Lititz, Pa. on Sunday morning repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”
“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.
A judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from being able to get their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.
In Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.
– Karissa Waddick
Top Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.
The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.
Trump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa in pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.
It’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning females voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.
– Zac Anderson
Sen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”
Fetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.
“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”
Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have made anti-trans attacks a major part of their closing message to voters in the 2024 election, arguing
– Karissa Waddick
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.
A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
In an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.
“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”
The Republican governor remained optimistic of his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: ""It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”
– Kathryn Palmer
Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.
""No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,"" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. ""In fact, it’s not even close!""
Even so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
A loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigns today in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.
–David Jackson
Indiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.
Actor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.
In the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”
Ford concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.
–Michael Collins
Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., appearing Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which he appeared to call Trump's supporters ""garbage.""
The president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.
""As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,"" Warnock said, adding that he believes ""That's what Kamala Harris is doing.""
– Marina Pitofsky
Could red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?
The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.
Yet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.
– Des Moines Register staff
The 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.
It's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.
– Marina Pitofsky
Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broke the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.
Carr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a “clear and blatant effort to evade,” the commissions rule, unless NBC offered Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.
“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.
Carr, who was appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.

It's never a bad time to start practicing — and reaping the benefits of! — yoga. This ancient practice offers options for all fitness levels and has become increasingly popular in the U.S., with about one in seven Americans practicing yoga, according to a 2017 national survey. While the complex inversions and more rigorous styles can be intimidating, there are many different types of yoga that can be approachable for anyone, at any age or physical ability.
""Start with a class designed for beginners,"" says Peloton Yoga and Meditation Director Ross Rayburn. He recommends beginners kick things off by practicing just once a week and building a more regular cadence from there.
Whether you plan to join a yoga studio or you want to take a virtual yoga class from home, we've compiled everything beginners need to know about starting a regular yoga practice. Of course, before beginning any new exercise regimen, our health and fitness experts recommend consulting with your healthcare provider.
Yoga is a spiritual and physical practice rooted in Indian philosophy that has existed for thousands of years, according to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. There are several different styles of yoga that range from gentle, meditative experiences to more physically intense formats. The mind-body exercise typically consists of doing sequences of physical poses combined with deep breathing techniques.
""Defining 'yoga' is a bit like trying to define a grand concept like spirituality or culture,"" Rayburn says. ""I’ve always been drawn to a dynamic definition that resonates differently depending on the person, time and place. Any practice, both internal and external, that weaves intention, knowledge and affirmative agency can be yoga.""
From improving strength and flexibility to helping manage stress, the benefits of regularly practicing yoga are vast, but the specific benefits you experience will differ based on the type of yoga you do, according to Rayburn. ""Alignment-based yoga can help with strength, flexibility and functionality, while meditational or devotional types of yoga can yield myriad benefits relating to mental and emotional health,"" he says. Some generally well-established yoga health benefits include:
Improved flexibility and balance
A 2016 study in the International Journal of Yoga found improvements in flexibility and balance among a group of male college athletes that practiced yoga twice a week, for a total of 10 weeks. A systematic review from 2019 supports those findings, confirming significant improvements in yogis' lower body flexibility.
Increased strength and muscle tone
One study that evaluated adults participating in a 12-week Hatha yoga intervention saw significant improvements in both cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength. Another study in sedentary adults found that a Hatha yoga regimen was as good as a stretching-strengthening exercise program in improving strength, flexibility, mobility and more.
Enhanced body awareness
Yoga has been long known to improve body awareness, primarily through its ability to connect breath and movement through the practice. A pilot study in 2022 found that a 12-week yoga course for individuals with multiple sclerosis significantly improved their body awareness.
Stress relief
You may feel the stress relief benefits of yoga after just one session. Older adults who practiced yoga regularly for eight weeks reported feeling less stressed — something a salivary cortisol test supported in a 2016 study. What's more, a 2017 study found that middle-aged women secreted lower amounts of cortisol (the stress hormone) after 90 minutes of yoga, compared to resting.
Weight management
A 2013 study analysis concluded that regular yoga practice can help promote weight loss and maintenance, combined with a healthy diet. Another study from 2018 published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity found that a regular yoga practice supported healthy eating, management of emotional eating and even increased capacity to be active.
Injury prevention
Since yoga can improve flexibility and mobility, it can be a great tool for fixing muscle imbalances and alleviating tightness than can contribute to future injuries.
Help with pain management
Scientists named yoga one of the most effective exercises for alleviating chronic pain in a 2017 study review. In a 2020 review of 25 randomized controlled trials, researchers found that 20 studies supported positive outcomes regarding yoga and back pain relief.
Manage chronic disease symptoms
Regular physical activity in general can help prevent several chronic diseases. When it comes to yoga, thousands of study participants in a year-long relaxation program involving meditation, yoga and prayer visited their doctors 43% less than the year before, according to 2015 research from Massachusetts General Hospital. Another set of studies out of UCLA found just 12 minutes of Kirtan Kriya meditation (which involves chanting and finger poses) every day for eight weeks helped decrease the immune system's inflammatory response, which is promising since inflammation levels are tied to pretty much every major disease.
When it comes to the best poses for beginners looking to start a yoga practice, Rayburn suggests starting with any of these common poses — try flowing through the sequence below to create a complete yoga workout at home.
Pro tip: Take your time and hold each movement for a few breaths before moving on to the next one.
This foundational pose can be relaxing and serve as a great reset during a class. If you ever need a second during your flow to regroup, you can always come back to child's pose.
Downward facing dog may be one of the first poses you'll learn in any yoga class, since it is an important part of many yoga practices. It's one of the main poses during sun salutations and something you can return to throughout class, as well.
Another favorite pose of Rayburn's, this one is great for stretching the lower body and opening up the chest.
This pose, also common in sun salutations, is ideal for improving posture as backbends are great for counteracting prolonged sitting.
This powerful pose is great for strengthening the legs, arms and core.
This empowering pose increases balance and strength. If you can't reach your fingertips all the way to the ground, consider utilizing a yoga block.
Great for opening the hips, this popular yoga pose targets the lower body and can provide a fantastic stretch. Ease into the movement and only fold forward if you feel stable once in position.
Another popular backbend, this pose can help improve posture and also relieve lower back pain.
Not only does this standing yoga pose help improve your balance and coordination, but it also focuses on posture and alignment. Engage your core to help steady yourself.
This grounding pose is all about relaxation and quieting the mind. If you feel any tension under your lower back, consider placing a rolled-up blanket beneath your knees.
Whether you're looking for a rigorous workout or a more meditative experience, there are a variety of yoga styles to meet your needs. Yoga was often referred to as a tree in ancient times, with six branches that include Raja (path of meditative focus), Karma (path of service), Bhakti (path of devotion), Jnana (path of wisdom and knowledge), Tantra (path of rituals) and Hatha (path that focuses on mastery of the body). You may gravitate towards one particular branch, but know that you can explore different paths and may find that many of these branches naturally overlap.
In terms of the types of yoga classes offered, some common ones you may encounter include:
If you're brand new to yoga, Rayburn says that taking a class specifically designed for beginners is ideal so you can learn proper form at the very beginning of your yoga journey. In general, you'll want to take your time with the movements and go slow, as the practice is designed to be mindful and purposeful in movement.
If your first class doesn't go as well as you wanted it to, don't get discouraged. ""Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that 'yoga is not for me' just because your first class is not the best experience,"" he says, adding that it may take a few classes to find an instructor that resonates with you and inspires you to practice regularly. Once you find the right class format and instructor, you'll start to feel more empowered by the yoga experience.
While you may be tempted to go hard in the beginning, it is crucial to listen to your body and know your limits. ""Notice if you’re not able to breathe deeply,"" suggests Rayburn. ""The breath can be a great guide for slowing down, modifying or taking a rest."" Also try to differentiate between feeling discomfort versus feeling acute sensations and pain. You can always return back to downward facing dog or child's pose whenever you need to reset during class.
Most yoga studios provide equipment, but check in advance to see if you'll need to bring anything to class. You may want to take your own mat for hygiene purposes, or if you have a particular preference on style and thickness. Some yoga studios will provide accessories for you, but if you're practicing yoga at home through a yoga app or online class, then you'll want to consider having a few things on hand:
When it comes to clothing, Rayburn says it depends on what makes you feel most comfortable. He generally recommends wearing yoga pants that allow you to move freely. Yoga is typically done barefoot, but if you prefer to wear socks, our experts suggest grip socks.

Paragraphs:
When you’re brand new to yoga, it can feel intimidating and be difficult to know exactly where and how to get started. Our Yoga for Beginners guide was created specifically for you—to give you all the tips, guidelines, and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. To ensure your success, we highly recommend you read this entire page before attempting any yoga.
Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body, and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment.
Hatha Yoga attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), and shatkarma (internal cleansing). These physical practices are used to purify the body and cultivate prana (life-force energy). Modern Hatha Yoga does not emphasize many of these esoteric practices and instead focuses more on the physical yoga postures.
Regardless of what your goals or intentions are for starting, just the yoga poses themselves is a fantastic form of mental and physical exercise.
Yoga is in no way exclusive—being able to practice yoga does not matter how old you are, how much you weigh, what you do for a living, where you live, or what religion you practice. Yoga is accessible for just about everyone.
If you have a medical condition or a recent injury, it can be challenging or dangerous to do certain types of yoga, specific poses, or breathing techniques. Usually, there are alternatives or modifications that can allow you to practice safely, and many common complaints have specific yoga therapy remedies. If you are recovering from an injury or are in poor health, we recommended consulting with a physician or other qualified health care professional before beginning yoga.
While you may feel some intensity in the belly of your muscles while in a yoga pose, you should never feel pain, especially in the joints. A sharp or intense pain is your body’s signal to tell you to stop, back off, and take it easy.
If you are out of shape or extremely inflexible, we recommend you begin with a gentle practice until you have built up the strength and flexibility for more challenging sequences. If you are a relatively fit and flexible person, you should be able to jump right into a regular hatha yoga class. Once you are familiar with the basic postures, you can explore a vinyasa or flow class. We recommend you avoid Ashtanga, Bikram, or hot yoga until you have built up some physical strength and endurance. It is always best to error on the side of caution and safety and approach yoga slowly and carefully. The best way to know if yoga is for you is to give it a try!
Yoga is typically performed in bare feet on a sticky yoga mat with optional yoga props. The yoga movements and poses require clothes that can stretch and move freely with your body. You can purchase clothing specifically designed for yoga practice, but you can probably put together a comfortable outfit from your existing wardrobe to get started.
Yoga classes may use additional props, the most common being straps, blocks, blankets, and bolsters. You don’t need to purchase these right away as you can easily substitute these items with scarves or neckties, a stack of books, and pillows. If you take classes at a yoga studio, they will provide everything that you need.
We recommend that you start with a short and straightforward yoga session and slowly build up from there. Once you feel comfortable with a few basic beginner yoga postures, you can incorporate them into a sequence and continue to add more challenging poses. Make sure you learn and follow the essential components of a yoga practice: breathing, meditation, intention, asanas, and relaxation.

If you can practice yoga 3 or more times per week, you will see significant improvements in your flexibility, range of motion, strength, balance, inner peace, and overall well being. Ideally, we recommend shorter and more frequent sessions, 20-45 minutes long, and for a total of 3-4 hours spread over several days. Practicing yoga less than this amount will still be beneficial, but you will see smaller improvements over a longer period of time. Like most things, the more time you can dedicate towards it, the more benefits you will receive.

The benefits of yoga are almost endless! Practicing yoga helps build healthy virtues and good values, such as discipline, honesty, devotion, self-inquiry, mindfulness, and non-attachment. Yoga empowers you to make conscious choices toward living a more healthy and fulfilling life. Yoga also helps you:
Patience, commitment, repetition, and consistency are the keys to developing and progressing in the practice of yoga. After you’ve found a style, teacher, and yoga studio that works for you, try these tips:

Practice Yoga for BeginnersOur Yoga for Beginners guide will give you the basic tips, guidelines and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. Meditation BasicsMeditation is a focusing of the mind on a single object, creating the cessation of all thought. As thoughts dissipate, the mind becomes quiet, and we are able to be fully in the present moment. The techniques of meditation are simple and easy to learn, but the ability to keep the mind focused takes time, patience and practice. The benefits of a regular meditation practice include reduction of stress, tension, anxiety and frustration, as well as improved memory, concentration, inner peace and whole body well-being. PranayamaPranayama are breathing exercises developed by the ancient yogis for purification. Prana translates into “life force energy” and Yama translates into “control or mastery of”. Thus, Pranyama is used to control, cultivate, and modify the Prana in the body. Prana is taken in through the air we breathe, and since the pranayama exercises increase the amount of air we take in, they also increase our intake of Prana. For all pranayama (except Kapalabhati), the breath is slow and steady, breathed in and out of the nose and down into the belly. Always sit with a straight spine and a relaxed body. While you are practicing pranayama, let go of any thoughts by focusing on the breathing involved with the pranayama. Yoga Postures Seated Yoga Poses Standing Yoga Poses Prone Yoga Poses Supine Yoga Poses Yoga Posture Sequences Warm-up SequencesUse these sequences of simple stretches to warm up prior to any of the pose sequences. Basic SequencesWhere to start if you are new or a beginner. These posture flows are simple, short and only contain basic postures. Beginning SequencesWhere to start if you have some previous experience with yoga. Build on the basic pose sequences by adding more length and challenge to the flow. For more beginning level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Sun SalutationsOften considered the core of hatha yoga practice, Sun Salutations are traditionally practiced at sunrise to warm and energize the body. We have several Sun Salutation sequences available with varying levels of difficulty, from basic to intermediate. Intermediate SequencesBy adding challenging postures to the beginning sequences, these posture flows are the most complex, vigorous and long. For more intermediate level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Special SequencesLooking for something different? These sequences are designed for specific applications, using combinations of yoga postures for their effects on the physical, mental, emotional and energetic bodies.

Learn Yoga 101: The BasicsYoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques, but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment. Though yoga’s ultimate aim is lofty, its essence is practical and scientific as it emphasizes direct experience and observable results. It is not a religion, but a practice of personal inquiry and exploration. As the cultural and religious diversity of practitioners attest, yogic philosophy speaks to universal truths that can be incorporated within any belief system. Philosophy of YogaThe main philosophy of yoga is simple: mind, body and spirit are all one and cannot be clearly separated. Yet there is a multitude of philosophical ideas developed by looking into the deeper dimensions of the body, mind and spirit. Energy AnatomyThe foundation of all life, of the whole universe, is the subtle life force energy the yogis call ‘prana.’ This mystical energy flows through our bodies and generates our every action – from gross physical movements to minute biochemical processes.Hatha and Tantra yogas have developed a rich description of the anatomy of the subtle or energy body, including the different types of energies, the nadi energy channels and chakra energy centers.

Yoga 101: The BasicsYoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques, but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment. Though yoga’s ultimate aim is lofty, its essence is practical and scientific as it emphasizes direct experience and observable results. It is not a religion, but a practice of personal inquiry and exploration. As the cultural and religious diversity of practitioners attest, yogic philosophy speaks to universal truths that can be incorporated within any belief system.
Philosophy of YogaThe main philosophy of yoga is simple: mind, body and spirit are all one and cannot be clearly separated. Yet there is a multitude of philosophical ideas developed by looking into the deeper dimensions of the body, mind and spirit.
Energy AnatomyThe foundation of all life, of the whole universe, is the subtle life force energy the yogis call ‘prana.’ This mystical energy flows through our bodies and generates our every action – from gross physical movements to minute biochemical processes.Hatha and Tantra yogas have developed a rich description of the anatomy of the subtle or energy body, including the different types of energies, the nadi energy channels and chakra energy centers. These yogas have also developed various methods to increase, cultivate and direct this spiritual energy.

""I had to come here to say something. Normally I have excruciating pain with crest white strips and this other brand I got from the dentist. Both of which didn’t whiten my teeth very much. So, I had low hopes for laughland. I got the formula made for highest sensitivity, and I left it on for I think 12 minutes. Just after the first day my teeth look 2 shades whiter. I’m actually really shocked.""
""My teeth had gotten so yellow that I didn't like smiling - especially when I wore lipstick, it made the teeth look more icky. 6 treatments later, it's gotten SO much whiter and I'm wearing lipstick again :)""
""I thought hey worth a shot not really expecting anything great. Wow was I wrong! This has absolutely worked wonders on my teeth! Refill kit has been ordered! I’m obsessed!""
""I. Hate. Whitening. Kits. Except this one. It's easy to use, doesn't create a huge mess, is comfortable (even for small-mouthed folks like me!), and doesn't make your teeth feel slimy and taste weird. Plus, it's SO EFFECTIVE. Worth every penny.""
""This is my best purchase ever. This item OVER-Delivers. My teeth are sparkling and I had ZERO pain. Great Job Laughland.""
""LOVE THIS! My coworkers have been throwing compliments left and right about how my teeth have been shining. THANK YOU!""
Laughland is the only whitening brand to create custom whitening formulas based on your quiz profile. Just as a dentist would prescribe a specific whitening treatment for you, we can optimize the strength of the whitening serum to your unique sensitivity levels, dental history and diet. Hence, our formulas are 3x more effective and clinically tested to show a 74% improvement in whiteness. It's the closest you'll get to a dentist, without having to go to one!
While you'll begin to see differences after your first 10+ minute treatment, but the most noticeable changes will come after 6 days of consecutive whitening treatments. You'll be pleasantly surprised :)
Each kit contains 3 syringes that last for 6 treatments. Results can be immediately noticeable, and lasts months depending on your diet and brushing habits. We recommend users to re-whiten every 2-3 months or as-needed to maintain a shine all year round.
Veneers, caps, implants, bonding or bridges aren’t designed to be whitened, however Laughland can whiten the surrounding teeth to maintain the same shade as your dental work.
We offer a flexible subscription to save you the trouble of re-ordering manually.
You can manage your subscription via your account or by emailing us at team@mylaughland.com anytime.
Our NanoLight technology LED light helps with teeth whitening by activating the ingredients in the whitening gel used during the treatment. Your custom gel contains a variety of bleaching agents that breaks down the stains on the surface of the teeth. When the light is shone on the teeth, it activates the whitening gel, speeding up the chemical reaction and helping the bleaching agent penetrate deeper into the enamel. This results in a more effective and efficient teeth whitening treatment, giving you a brighter and more confident smile. It is important to note that the LED light alone will not change the color of your teeth, but rather enhances the effectiveness of the whitening gel.

Paragraphs:
Reddit's best place for all things yoga.
If you want to learn how to do yoga, you’re in the right place! It will transform your life, but I’ll be the first to admit it can be intimidating to start. What are the poses? What do I wear? Where do I go? It’s a bit overwhelming, but it doesn’t need to be.
Here are a couple resources for you to check out when you have some time:
https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene Disclaimer: I've never actually taken her classes, but the online world raves about her videos. She offers a large variety, so this could be a great place to start. And they are free (yay!)
Just by the titles, these are the ones I would start with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYKMP6rOE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiKJRoX_2uo
Adriene also had a 30 day yoga series that could be worth trying too.
I've done a different 30 day challenge from another girl (Erin Motz - The Bad Yogi) and it was a great way to become familiar with the poses and practice regularly. BONUS: the videos are pretty short so it's easy to fit into your schedule and they are free. Here is the link to day one of her 30 day series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbrutThDk7o
This is my FAVORITE yogi of all time - Rachel Brathen. She is @yoga_girl on insta and I went to her yoga retreat a few years ago and it was amazing. UGH I want to go back! https://oneoeight.com/?gclid=CMX6odvfiNECFdU8gQodmQoMrg I pay $14/month for these classes but they have a 10 day free trial you could check out. They have a huge variety of teachers on there, but I've only taken Rachel's classes and they are so good! and kick my ass. I believe they also have meditation on here (I've never tried it) but that could be cool too.
Anyways - this should be good to at least get you started at home. If you find you're interested it would be worth going to a studio (or two) and see which ones you like. I recommend two things: Try to find a groupon. You can get amazing deals this way! See what new student discounts the studio offers. Many of them have a special deal for students who have never been there before Okay, I just thought of a third point… search for local community (or donation based) yoga classes. I usually donate $5-10 per class.
There you have it! My favorite resources to kick start your yoga practice. Of course - if you have any questions you can ask me. I am here to help :)

If you’re a beginner to yoga, it can seem intimidating. Between the gravity-defying poses you see on Instagram and the overwhelming array of class options, it can be easy to think of yoga as exclusive. The truth is, yoga is for everyone and you don’t need gymnast-level flexibility to give it a try. In fact, the reason you do yoga isn’t because you’re flexible—it’s to become more flexible in your body as well as your life.
Here, you’ll find everything you need to know about yoga for beginners: the benefits of a regular practice, beginner poses, how to find the right class for you, practicing at home, and more.
The word “yoga” derives from a Sanskrit word that means “to yoke” or “to unite.” This makes sense when you consider that yoga is a practice meant to unite the mind, body, and spirit.
Much of the yoga practiced in the West today focuses strongly on asana, meaning the physical practice, but the physical postures are just one aspect of yoga. There are ancient philosophical texts that define yoga as a state of mind that has nothing to do with physical postures and movements.
“Yoga” is a very old term that originated in India, explains Indu Arora, an Ayurveda and yoga therapist and author of Yoga: Ancient Heritage, Tomorrow’s Vision. “Its roots are found in ancient texts called Vedas, which are about 3,000- to 5,000-year-old texts,” she says.
As Arora explains, yoga is “that harmonious, peaceful, content, still state of mind. Whenever we have found that, we are in that state of yoga.”
That’s why focusing on your breath—pranayama—is considered an essential component of yoga. “Prana” refers to life force or breath sustaining the body; “ayama” means “to extend” or “to draw out.” The two together mean breath extension or control. Some yoga teachers consider pranayama as the most important part of the practice.
When you begin to practice yoga regularly, you’ll unlock a host of health benefits. Because yoga engages the mind, body, and spirit, these span the physical, mental, and emotional realms.
The moving, stretching, and deep breathing during a yoga practice improves blood flow and both stretches and strengthens muscles.
Yoga shows promise for relieving certain kinds of chronic and acute pain—especially low back pain, according to research.
Factors such as stress and a sedentary lifestyle can trigger chronic inflammation, which in turn can raise your risk for disease. Yoga may be a powerful antidote. Studies have found that practicing yoga may help lower blood levels of an inflammation-promoting immune cell called IL-6 and cortisol, also known as the “stress hormone.”
The evidence is overwhelming: Yoga appears to be an effective way to boost heart health, help manage heart conditions, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Yoga has been found to help decrease depressive symptoms and significantly reduce stress and anxiety. Research continues to find that meditation is effective in relieving symptoms of depression as well.
The practice of holding postures, breathing intentionally, and meditating all train you to fine-tune your attention by syncing your breathing with movement, focusing on the subtleties of your inhalations and exhalations, and letting go of distracting thoughts.
Studies have also shown that a regular yoga practice promotes positive emotions and body image. “Yoga has helped me to deal with life struggles,” says Kiesha Battles, yoga teacher and trainer, and co-director of the Yoga Retreat for Women of Color. “It allows me to have more clarity in the way I see things so that I can deal with troubles or problems.”
When practiced consistently, yoga may help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep, decrease sleep disturbances, and improve sleep quality.
RELATED The Benefits of Yoga: 38 Ways Yoga Can Improve Your Life
If you’ve ever browsed yoga class schedules, you’ve likely encountered a slew of options—including some with names that you don’t understand. These typically signify various types of yoga with approaches that vary in intensity, focus, and styles. Following are some styles of yoga you may encounter:
Here are six basic yoga poses that are beginner-friendly. There are many variations of each yoga pose that can help make them more accessible to your unique body.
Although it may look like a simple standing position, Mountain Pose engages your leg muscles and your core, while establishing greater body awareness and alignment.
How to:
Cat Pose can help relieve tension in your low, middle, and upper back, as well as improve posture. This pose is often paired with Cow Pose (see below) for a gentle flow. How to:
Cow Pose can be done on your hands and knees, or even in a seated position during chair yoga. Cow Pose may help increase mobility, especially for people experiencing muscle and joint stiffness. How to:
Cobra Pose may help improve symptoms of chronic low back pain by increasing flexibility and core strength. Though you may see yogis straightening their arms and more deeply arching their backs, it’s okay to stay low to the ground, especially if you’re new to Cobra Pose.
How to:
Child’s Pose and its variations provide a stretch for the lower back and hips. This pose is often recommended for yogis to return to throughout a class or sequence.
How to:
Yogis rest in Savasana at the end of each practice. This pose offers a chance to find inner stillness after the physical movement of a yoga class.
Savasana may provide deep relaxation, which promotes stress reduction.
How to:
There are many different breathwork, or pranayama, techniques, including simply slowing your breath. Another common and traditional form of breathwork is Ujjayi. This type of breathing pattern is approximately equal length inhalations and exhalations and should feel both energizing and relaxing. It’s created by gently constricting the opening of the throat to create some resistance to the passage of air. An effective Ujjayi breath renders a soothing sound.
At the beginning of class, a yoga teacher may guide students through one or more breathing techniques, including Ujjayi as well as:

It’s normal if you feel awkward when you first start practicing yogic breathwork. Try to be patient with yourself and over time, you may become more comfortable and reap the benefits breathwork can offer.
In a study in the International Journal of Yoga, researchers found that pranayama is linked with stress relief, improved cardiovascular health and respiratory function, and enhanced cognition.
A well-known saying goes something like “Movement with awareness is yoga. Movement without awareness is exercise.” That awareness includes attention to your breath as you move throughout the poses.

In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, a text compiled by an ancient sage named Patanjali, many different concepts of yoga are brought together under one umbrella, Arora explains. The result is structured guidance on how to achieve a yogic state of mind.
As Patanjali explains, yoga encompasses eight limbs (or steps) that essentially serve as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. These limbs are a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline, direct attention toward one’s health, and help us acknowledge the spiritual aspects of our nature as humans.
The eight limbs of yoga are:
You don’t need to know a ton about how to do yoga before you attend your first class. “That’s why you’re there—you’re there to learn,” says Susanna Barkataki, yoga teacher trainer and author of Embrace Yoga’s Roots: Courageous Ways to Deepen Your Yoga Practice.
Start by doing a Google search for “Beginner yoga classes near me.” Some yoga studios have class schedules on their websites while others use apps. Most studios prefer that students reserve classes ahead of time, which you can often do online, in order to ensure classes aren’t overbooked and students aren’t turned away at the door.
Classes that are described as foundational, gentle, or beginner are great options if you’re just starting out. So are restorative or yin yoga classes.
Of course, it may help to email or call your local yoga studio to ask whether a particular class is beginner-friendly. If you have any injuries or health conditions, you may also choose to disclose that to the studio or the teacher, who can advise you on which of their classes would best suit your needs.
If you want to try beginner yoga at home before ever stepping foot into a studio, there are tons of free resources online for yogis. Check out these 10-minute beginner yoga videos:

There is no dress code for most yoga classes. But you’ll want to make sure that the fabric you wear is stretchy enough to accommodate movement. While yoga pants are popular, you can wear gym shorts, sweatpants, a sweat-wicking workout top, a t-shirt, a sports bra—anything you’re most comfortable in.
If it’s your first time going to yoga class at a studio, you most likely don’t need to bring anything (aside from a water bottle to stay hydrated). It’s common practice for people to rent a yoga mat from the studio or bring their own. If you borrow a mat, many studios provide sanitizing wipes so you can clean the mat before and after use.
As you practice more, you’ll learn what you need for a comfortable experience. You may choose to purchase your own yoga mat and even, if you practice at home, other props such as blocks and blankets.
Using props is about making yoga comfortable and accessible for you. Yoga instructors will often show various modifications for a single pose using props that the studio provides.
Common yoga props include:
Keep in mind that yoga is a mind-body-spirit practice that is about much more than just fitness. So if your yoga class incorporates some non-movement elements—such as breathwork, meditation, or intention-setting (sankalpa) at the beginning of class—be open to those aspects of the practice.
In India, where yoga originated, it’s a sign of respect to remove your shoes before you enter someone’s home, temple, or practice space. The same is expected in a yoga class.
While many teachers provide hands-on adjustments for students, know that you have the right to decline. Some teachers may ask students to raise their hands at the beginning of class if they do not wish to be touched throughout a practice. You can also tell your teacher directly before the practice begins. Always speak up if any hands-on adjustments make you feel uncomfortable in any way. “I think that’s another piece of the etiquette going both ways,” says Barkataki.
Many, but certainly not all, yoga teachers call poses by their Sanskrit names, in addition to or instead of their English interpretations. Don’t feel like you need to brush up on this ancient Indian language before taking your first yoga class. However, it’s helpful to understand the meaning of certain well-known Sanskrit words and phrases. If you hear something in class you don’t understand, simply ask the teacher to explain it to you after class.
The following are some common yoga terms:

Ah the hour-long yoga class. It’s quite luxurious, isn’t it? But let’s be frank—some days, it seems impossible to carve out a large chunk of time for your practice. If you ever feel this way (and who hasn’t?) know this: even a few minutes of movement can make a huge difference in how you approach … Continued

Basic Yoga Class Etiquette
Common Yoga Terms
Vinyasa Yoga: Vinyasa classes typically comprise a sequence of poses that are moved through with one movement per breath.
Restorative Yoga: A Restorative yoga class typically involves only five or six relaxing poses—supported by props, such as blankets, bolsters, pillows, blocks, or stacks of books—that you linger in for several minutes. The postures are designed to help you to release tension and rest.
Hot Yoga: Any style of yoga practiced in an intentionally heated room is hot yoga. The temperature is believed to encourage increased flexibility, although it’s important to exert caution.
Yin Yoga: A relatively recently developed style, Yin yoga involves variations of seated and supine stretches that are typically held for 3 to 5 minutes to access fascia, a type of connective tissue that is the subject of much research. Exerting subtle tension on fascia can improve flexibility and minimize recovery time from injuries.
Ashtanga Yoga: An athletic and demanding practice based on several set sequences of postures that remain the same, an Ashtanga yoga practice is taught in increasing levels of difficulty. Beginners start with the Primary Series.
Hatha Yoga: Unlike vinyasa, Hatha yoga focuses on individual poses and not the linking of poses from one to the next. The practice is meant to deepen your understanding of each pose.
Yoga Therapy: Any yogic technique used to systematically address physical injury or pain, as well as mental and emotional stress or trauma, can be considered yoga therapy.
Iyengar Yoga: By paying careful attention to the alignment of each posture, Iyengar yoga is the practice of precision. Poses are held for extended periods of time and students are often supported with props to experience the posture’s intended alignment.
Jivamukti Yoga: This style of yoga is defined by incorporating chanting, meditation, pranayama, philosophy, and music into a vigorous vinyasa practice. Jivamukti is a physically and intellectually stimulating type of yoga.
Kundalini Yoga: A blend of spiritual and physical practices, Kundalini yoga includes less of an emphasis on movement and more on dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and the chanting of mantras.
Power Yoga: This practice flows from one pose to the next. Power yoga has many of the same qualities as Ashtanga and some types of vinyasa, including building internal heat, increasing stamina, enhancing strength and flexibility, as well as reducing stress.
Prenatal Yoga: With an emphasis on breathing, stamina, pelvic floor work, restorative poses, and core strength, prenatal yoga can be practiced both during and after pregnancy.
Tantra Yoga: By harnessing and embodying the five forces of Shakti, the divine feminine that represents creativity and change, tantric yoga intends to help you move through the world with more confidence and contentment.
Stand with your big toes touching, heels slightly apart.
Reach your tailbone toward the floor.
Broaden your collarbones and let your arms hang at your sides, palms facing forward.
Hold Mountain Pose for up to 10 breaths.
Start on your hands and knees with your knees directly below your hips and your wrists, elbows, and shoulders in line.
As you exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling and release your head toward the floor without forcing your chin to your chest.
Repeat Cat Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Start on your hands and knees. Make sure your knees are directly below your hips and your wrists; elbows and shoulders are in line.
As you inhale, lift your sitting bones and chest toward the ceiling, allowing your belly to sink toward the floor. Lift your head to look straight forward.
Exhale, coming back to your hands and knees.
Repeat Cow Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Lie on your stomach with your palms on the floor, fingertips in line with the middle of your chest. Place a folded towel or blanket underneath your hip bones for added cushioning. Extend your legs.
Slowly press your palms into the floor and draw your shoulder blades together. Keep your shoulders down.
Keep a deep bend in both arms as you expand your chest forward.
Hold for 5 to 10 breaths and slowly lower yourself back down to the floor.
Begin in a seated position with your bottom on top of your feet, placing a rolled blanket or towel in between if it’s more comfortable.
Touch your big toes together and widen your knees out to the side as you slowly walk your hands out in front of you.
Bring your forehead to the floor. If it’s more accessible, place a book, block, or blanket beneath your forehead.
Stay in this position anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. To come out of Child’s Pose, slowly walk your hands back toward your body and rise up to seated.
Lie down slowly onto your back and soften (but don’t flatten) your lower back onto the floor. If it’s more comfortable, support the back of your head and neck on a folded blanket or towel.
Release your arms to the floor. Rest the backs of your hands on the floor. Make sure your shoulder blades are resting evenly on the floor.
Soften your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. Relax your face.
Try to stay in this pose for at least 5 minutes at the end of your practice. To exit, first roll gently with an exhalation onto one side. Take 2 or 3 breaths. With another exhalation press your hands against the floor and lift your torso, dragging your head slowly after. Your head should always come up last.
Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)
Cooling Breath (Shitali Pranayama)
Breath of Fire (Kapalabhati Pranayama)
Yama (ethical standards toward others)
Niyama (self-discipline and inner observances)
Asana (physical postures, which many Westerners think of as yoga)
Pranayama (breath control)
Pratyahara (sensory transcendence)
Dharana (concentration)
Dhyana (meditation)
Samadhi (self-realization)
Yoga mats: You may be surprised to learn that yoga mats are not a must, says Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga. “You really don’t have to use a yoga mat unless you really want that stickiness, that extra traction,” he explains. In lieu of a mat, you could practice on wood floors, with a towel, or on carpeting, especially if you’re practicing at home.
Yoga Blanket: This item is a staple in restorative yoga and can also be used to support your knees, wrists, and back throughout any practice. Look for a blanket that is thick in texture to ensure you have adequate support, Battles advises.
Yoga Blocks: Blocks are another common prop that effectively brings the floor to you in various poses and adds stability and balance to your practice. Blocks are often used by beginner and experienced yogis alike to help them work within the limitations of their bodies and allow them to find alignment with less strain.
Yoga Straps: Straps, explains Battles, extend your reach in postures. If you have a stiff lower back or tight hamstrings, for example, the strap allows you to find alignment in more poses. You can buy a yoga strap or instead use a long, flexible item like a towel, belt, sweatshirt, or tie.
Asana: Refers to the physical practice of yoga or poses
Chakra: Relates to the seven energetic parts of the body that we can’t see or touch but that connect us to universal energy
Mantra: A word or phrase that is repeated during yoga practice and meditation
Namaste: A sign of respect often said between yoga teachers and their students at the end of class

Paragraphs:
The British government has banned the phrase fake news from appearing in official papers or documents after ruling the term is ""poorly defined and misleading.""
Instead, ministers will have to use the words disinformation when referring to the act of purposely spreading false information and misinformation when it occurs inadvertently.
The suggestion to ban the phrase often used by President Donald Trump during his attacks on the media was made in a report by the U.K. Parliament's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee, as the term fake news is ""bandied around with no clear idea of what it means.""
""The term has taken on a variety of meanings, including a description of any statement that is not liked or agreed with by the reader,"" the recommendation said.
The British government responded: ""We agree that 'fake news' is a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.
""Over the past several months during its work on this issue the Government has sought to move away from 'fake news' and instead has sought to address 'disinformation' and wider online manipulation.
""In our work we have defined disinformation as the deliberate creation and sharing of false and/or manipulated information that is intended to deceive and mislead audiences, either for the purposes of causing harm, or for political, personal or financial gain. 'Misinformation' refers to the inadvertent sharing of false information.""
However, British politicians will still be allowed to use the phrase if they wish while speaking in the House of Commons, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Avoiding the phrase was one of 42 recommendations made in the committee's report, titled ""Disinformation and 'Fake News.'"" The interim report, published in July, warned that ""democracy is at risk"" if more isn't done to combat alleged foreign interference in elections or the use of manipulation of personal data to spread disinformation.
The interim report was set up in the wake of continuing concerns over Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
Only three of the report's 42 recommendations were accepted outright by the British government, with four recommendations rejected, the committee confirmed in a statement.
Damian Collins, the committee's chair and a Conservative member of Parliament for Folkestone and Hythe, said he is ""disappointed"" by the government's response to the report.
""We need to see a more coordinated approach across government to combat campaigns of disinformation being organized by Russian agencies seeking to disrupt and undermine our democracy,"" Collins said. ""The government's response gives us no real indication of what action is being taken on this important issue.""

Paragraphs:
Conspiracy theories claiming 5G technology helps transmit coronavirus have been condemned by the scientific community.
Videos have been shared on social media showing mobile phone masts on fire in Birmingham and Merseyside - along with the claims.
The UK's mobile networks have reported 20 cases of masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital.
The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.
TV regulator Ofcom is assessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmes in which he cast doubts on media outlets for their attempts to debunk the claims.
But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible.
The conspiracy theories have been branded ""the worst kind of fake news"" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis.
Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus.
These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US.
They appear to fall broadly in to two camps:
One claims 5G can suppress the immune system, thus making people more susceptible to catching the virus.
The other suggests the virus can somehow be transmitted through the use of 5G technology.
Both these notions are ""complete rubbish,"" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading.
Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside, prompting investigations
""The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,"" Dr Clarke says.
""Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.""
While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect.
""Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.""
The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.
It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds.
""The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,"" he says.
It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology.
There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece: Does 5G pose health risks?
Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, saying there was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses.
But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated.
Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were ""concerning,"" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is ""absolutely no credible evidence for the link"".
Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes.
Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

h1: How Teens In The Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News

Paragraphs:
BuzzFeed News identified more than 100 pro-Trump websites being run from a single town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
BuzzFeed Founding Editor, Canada
BuzzFeed Contributor
""This is the news of the millennium!"" said the story on WorldPoliticus.com. Citing unnamed FBI sources, it claimed Hillary Clinton will be indicted in 2017 for crimes related to her email scandal.
""Your Prayers Have Been Answered,"" declared the headline.
For Trump supporters, that certainly seemed to be the case. They helped the baseless story generate over 140,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.
Meanwhile, roughly 6,000 miles away in a small town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a young man watched as money began trickling into his Google AdSense account.
Over the past year, the Macedonian town of Veles (population 45,000) has experienced a digital gold rush as locals launched at least 140 US politics websites. These sites have American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, and USADailyPolitics.com. They almost all publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the US.
The young Macedonians who run these sites say they don't care about Donald Trump. They are responding to straightforward economic incentives: As Facebook regularly reveals in earnings reports, a US Facebook user is worth about four times a user outside the US. The fraction-of-a-penny-per-click of US display advertising — a declining market for American publishers — goes a long way in Veles. Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook — and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters.
As a result, this strange hub of pro-Trump sites in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is now playing a significant role in propagating the kind of false and misleading content that was identified in a recent BuzzFeed News analysis of hyperpartisan Facebook pages. These sites open a window into the economic incentives behind producing misinformation specifically for the wealthiest advertising markets and specifically for Facebook, the world's largest social network, as well as within online advertising networks such as Google AdSense.
""Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that 'if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,'"" said a university student in Veles who started a US politics site, and who agreed to speak on the condition that BuzzFeed News not use his name.
Sample stories from US politics sites run by Macedonians.
Using domain name registration records and online searches, BuzzFeed News identified over 100 active US politics websites being run from Veles. The largest of these sites have Facebook pages that boast hundreds of thousands of followers.
BuzzFeed News also identified another 40 US politics domains registered by people in Veles that are no longer active. (An April report from the Macedonian website Meta.mk identified six pro-Trump sites being run from Veles. A Guardian report identified 150 politics sites.)
Their reasons for launching these sites are purely financial, according to the Macedonians with whom BuzzFeed News spoke.
""I started the site for a easy way to make money,"" said a 17-year-old who runs a site with four other people. ""In Macedonia the economy is very weak and teenagers are not allowed to work, so we need to find creative ways to make some money. I'm a musician but I can't afford music gear. Here in Macedonia the revenue from a small site is enough to afford many things.""
Most of the posts on these sites are aggregated, or completely plagiarized, from fringe and right-wing sites in the US. The Macedonians see a story elsewhere, write a sensationalized headline, and quickly post it to their site. Then they share it on Facebook to try and generate traffic. The more people who click through from Facebook, the more money they earn from ads on their website.
Earlier in the year, some in Veles experimented with left-leaning or pro–Bernie Sanders content, but nothing performed as well on Facebook as Trump content.
""People in America prefer to read news about Trump,"" said a Macedonian 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com.
BuzzFeed News' research also found that the most successful stories from these sites were nearly all false or misleading.
For example, the most successful post BuzzFeed News found from a Macedonian site is based on a story from a fake news website. The headline on the story from ConservativeState.com was ""Hillary Clinton In 2013: 'I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They’re Honest And Can’t Be Bought.'"" The post is a week old and has racked up an astounding 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. (To put that into perspective, the New York Times' exclusive story that revealed Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns generated a little more than 175,000 Facebook interactions in a month.)
The viral Clinton story was sourced from TheRightists.com, a site that admits it publishes both real and fake content. According to emails released by WikiLeaks, Clinton said in a private speech to Goldman Sachs that she would like to see more successful business people enter politics. But she did not mention Donald Trump in any way. The quote used in the headline is false.
The original hoax from The Rightists.
Four of the five most successful posts from the Macedonian sites BuzzFeed News identified are false. They include the false claim that the pope endorsed Trump, and the false claim that Mike Pence said Michelle Obama is the ""most vulgar first lady we've ever had."" Those four posts together generated more than 1 million shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. That resulted in huge traffic and significant ad revenue for the owners of these sites, with many people being misinformed along the way.
The Macedonians BuzzFeed News spoke to said the explosion in pro-Trump sites in Veles means the market has now become crowded, making it harder to earn money. The people who launched their sites early in 2016 are making the most money, according to the university student. He said a friend of his earns $5,000 per month, ""or even $3,000 per day"" when he gets a hit on Facebook.
The 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com with a partner said he also runs health websites in addition to the US politics site. They launched the site in early 2016 and it's now averaging 1 million page views a month, said his partner. (The teens declined to share revenue figures.)
The 17-year-old and his three partners are still waiting for Google's AdSense program to approve their site for ads. As of now, they're only generating about 800 views a day and aren't earning any revenue. The university student launched his site in August and stopped updating it in order to focus on another, more successful site he has that's focused on health and well-being. He estimated there are ""thousands"" of health-related sites being run out of Veles. US politics is just this year's opportunity, thanks to a combination of Trump and Facebook.
""I stopped because I didn't really enjoy doing it and we didn't actually make any money from it since there are so many people posting already,"" the university student said. ""The people who started early are the ones reaping the rewards.""
Aside from the allure of easy money, they also have an element of pride that web-savvy people — including teenagers — in a small country like Macedonia can earn money by gaming Facebook, Google, and Americans.
""A good chunk of the world thinks Macedonia is primitive, but that is not true,"" the 17-year-old said.
The young men running these sites know the Trump traffic bonanza will soon come to an end. They expect traffic and revenue to decline significantly once the election is over. But they also hold out hope that a Trump win will keep their sites afloat.
""If Trump loses I plan to redirect my site to sports,"" the 16-year-old's partner said. ""It means that there will be no more politics [worth covering].""

Paragraphs:
Deepfake videos are a portmanteau word - 'deep' from 'deep learning' and 'fake', obviously, from 'fake'. Deep learning is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) method which uses multiple layers of machine learning algorithms to extract progressively higher-level features from raw input. It's capable of learning from unstructured data - such as the human face. For instance, an AI can gather data on your physical movements.
That data can then be processed in order to create a Deepfake video through a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). This is another kind of specialized machine learning system. Two neural networks are used to compete with each other in learning the characteristics of a training set (for instance, photographs of faces) and then generating new data with the same characteristics (new 'photographs').
Because such a network keeps testing the images it creates against the training set, the fake images become increasingly convincing. This makes Deepfake an ever more potent threat. Plus, GANs can fake other data besides photos and video. In fact, the same Deepfake machine learning and synthesizing techniques can be used to fake voices.

High profile Deepfake examples are not hard to find. One example of a Deepfake is the video issued by actor Jordan Peele in which he used real footage of Barack Obama merged with his own impression of Obama to issue a warning against Deepfake videos. He then showed how the two halves of the merged video looked when separated. His advice? We need to question what we see.
A video of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appearing to talk about how Facebook ’controls the future’ via stolen user data - notably on Instagram. The original video comes from a speech he gave on Russian election interference - just 21 seconds of that speech were enough to synthesize the new video. However, the voice impersonation wasn't as good as Jordan Peele's Obama and gave the truth away.
But even less well-made fakes can have a remarkable impact. A video of Nancy Pelosi 'drunk' scored millions of views on YouTube – but it was simply a fake made by slowing down a video artificially to give the effect of her slurring her words. And many celebrity women have found themselves 'starring' in revenge porn made by morphing their faces into porn films and images.
Deepfake videos have been used for political purposes, as well as for personal revenge. But increasingly they're being used in major attempts at blackmail and fraud.
The CEO of a British energy firm was tricked out of $243,000 by a voice Deepfake of the head of his parent company requesting an emergency transfer of funds. The fake was so convincing that he didn't think to check; the funds were wired not to the head office, but to a third party's bank account. The CEO only became suspicious when his 'boss' requested another transfer. This time, alarm bells rang - but it was too late to get back the funds he'd already transferred.
In France, a recent fraud didn't use Deepfake tech, but used impersonation, together with meticulous copying of Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian's office and its furnishings, to defraud senior executives of millions of euros. Fraudster Gilbert Chikli is alleged to have disguised himself as the minister to ask wealthy individuals and company executives for ransom money to liberate French hostages in Syria; he's currently standing trial.

It's also possible that Deepfake authors could blackmail company presidents by threatening to publish a damaging Deepfake video unless they're paid off. Or intruders could get into your network simply by synthesizing a video call from your Chief Information Officer, tricking employees into giving up passwords and privileges, which then lets hackers run riot all over your sensitive databases.
Deepfake porn videos have already been used to blackmail female reporters and journalists, such as Rana Ayyub in India, who exposes abuses of power. As the technology becomes cheaper, expect to see more uses of Deepfake to blackmail and defraud.
Legislation is already beginning to address the threats of Deepfake videos. For instance, in the state of California, two bills passed last year made aspects of Deepfake illegal - AB-602 banned the use of human image synthesis to make pornography without the consent of the people depicted and AB-730 banned manipulation of images of political candidates within 60 days of an election.
But is this going far enough? Fortunately, cyber-security companies are coming up with more and better detection algorithms all the time. These analyze the video image and spot the tiny distortions which are created in the ‘faking’ process. For instance, current Deepfake synthesizers model a 2D face, and then distort it to fit the 3D perspective of the video; looking at which way the nose is pointing is a key giveaway.
Deepfake videos are still at a stage where you can spot the signs yourself. Look for the following characteristics of a Deepfake video:
But as Deepfakes get better, you'll get less help from your own eyes and more from a good cyber-security program.
Some emerging technologies are now helping video makers authenticate their videos. A cryptographic algorithm can be used to insert hashes at set intervals during the video; if the video is altered, the hashes will change. AI and blockchain can register a tamper-proof digital fingerprint for videos. It's similar to watermarking documents; the difficulty with video is that the hashes need to survive if the video is compressed for use with different codecs.
Another way to repel Deepfake attempts is to use a program that inserts specially designed digital ‘artifacts’ into videos to conceal the patterns of pixels that face detection software uses. These then slow down Deepfake algorithms and lead to poor quality results — making the chances of successful Deepfaking less likely.
But technology isn't the only way to protect against Deepfake videos. Good basic security procedures are remarkably efficient at countering Deepfake.
For instance, having automatic checks built into any process for disbursing funds would have stopped many Deepfake and similar frauds. You can also:
Remember that if Deepfake starts to be deployed by hackers in their attempts to break into home and business networks, then basic cyber-security best practice will play a vital role when it comes to minimizing the risk:
Deepfake keeps evolving. Two years ago, it was really easy to tell Deepfake videos by the clunky quality of the movement and the fact that the faked person never seemed to blink. But the latest generation of fake videos has evolved and adapted.
There are estimated to be over 15,000 Deepfake videos out there right now. Some are just for fun, while others are trying to manipulate your opinions. But now that it only takes a day or two to make a new Deepfake, that number could rise very rapidly.

Ensure employees and family know about how Deepfaking works and the challenges it can pose.
Educate yourself and others on how to spot a Deepfake.
Make sure you are media literate and use good quality news sources.
Have good basic protocols - ""trust but verify"". A skeptical attitude to voicemail and videos won't guarantee you'll never be deceived, but it can help you avoid many traps.
Regular backups protect your data against ransomware and gives you the ability to restore damaged data.
Using different, strong passwords for different accounts means just because one network or service has been broken into doesn't mean any others have been compromised. If someone gets into your Facebook account, you don't want them to be able to get into your other accounts as well.
Use a good security package such as Kaspersky's Kaspersky Premium to protect your home network, laptop and smartphone against cyber threats. This package provides anti-virus software, a VPN to stop your Wi-Fi connections being hacked, and protection for your webcams, as well.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
The Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a compact, fast and useful laptop that offers great performance for everyday tasks for everyone in the family due to its portability, let me further explain. The Chromebook 311 has a nice 11.6 inch screen, and it is perfect for movability. It is also lightweight just less than 3 lbs. so it is easy to carry around, either at home, class or maybe at a favorite spot. I like how it feels, it feels sturdy and durable all around and it can withstand minor bumps and drops. It is powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and it has 4GB of RAM, so it easily handles everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, and streaming best of all it does it well. It works great wirelessly, using Wi-Fi connection all around the house it has worked flawlessly. It does have an HD Webcam with dual built in speakers so our kids can take an online class or just to communicate with others, and it does come with a webcam cover for privacy. Another thing we like about the Chromebook is its good battery life. It can last up to 8 hours on a single charge and that is plenty for most people including our kids at home as well as us adults. Since the Chromebook runs on Chrome OS, it is like having my Android cell phone with a bigger screen, keyboard and touchpad which they are responsive and comfortable to use by the way. The system is easy to use and I can access my Google Drive, Google Docs as well as other applications from the Google App store. Overall, the Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a great choice for family like ours, that we can share it since it is very portable and reliable for everyday use. Now that the kids have recently returned to school, they are ready to use the Chromebook too.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
I am quite pleased with the newest Acer 311. The build quality is decent despite being all plastic. That makes it lighter and more portable. The screen can lay 180° flat, stays up, and does not wobble. The keys have very good travel and feel very tactile. The trackpad is plastic but has a nice feel and is clicky. The bezels are bigger than I’d prefer, making the 11.6” display seem smaller. The HD (1366 x 768) screen has acceptable brightness but is a bit washed out and has pretty bad viewing angles. Nevertheless, I can see all text, graphics, and vide clearly. Sadly, there is no touchscreen support. The sound is what you’d expect from a small laptop. OK volume, clear, but no bass whatsoever. About connectivity, we have a USB-C 3.2 and a USB-A 3.1 port. The USB-C doubles as a power delivery and display port. The laptop is Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth compatible and works well and fast. There’s also a 3.8mm audio headphone jack. The N4500 CPU, Intel UHD Graphics, 4GB LPDDR4X memory combined make for a very smooth Chromebook workflow. I had several internet tabs open, (within reason), watched video, did productivity work, played super-basic games, and yes, streamed games with relatively no issues or slowdown. I did notice the laptop got bit warm but nothing uncomfortable and the fans were not loud at all. The 64GB storage is low but considering that this is designed to be used with cloud support, makes it sufficient. The battery life ranges between 8-10 hours depending on the use -good enough for a full workday. The 720P webcam is nothing to write home about but good enough for those basic video calls. I appreciate the included security cam cover. In the end, I think this Chromebook is quite portable and capable of handling everyday tasks. It’s perfect for student use and for anyone that is looking for simplicity and security. While the price could have been a bit lower, this is a great budget option.

This is a basic Chromebook, without any frills. But if your needs are limited, it does get the job done. == Build Quality == The packaging is minimal and without frills, but that is OK as I would rather the money go towards the computer than something that will be thrown away. Once you open up the machine itself, it seems to be decently built. It is all plastic construction, but you expect that for this price. The bottom features no air vents at all, and this machine has no moving parts; not even a single fan. But given the limited power, this is perfectly acceptable, and means that there is less to break in the future. == Peripherals == Being a budget device, the name of the game is giving you basic functionality for as little money as possible, and this has been done well. Obviously some corners were cut, but nothing was cut back in such a way that caused any problems. Everything here falls squarely in the “usable but not impressive” category. The keyboard is acceptable. It works and feels good, but it is not backlit at all. The trackpad is also well done, despite having a plastic surface. Multi-touch gestures also work well, but it is not especially smooth or gigantic. But it is adequate, and that is enough for this type of machine. There is a camera above the display that is more than good enough for Zoom or Teams meetings, and although it lacks a privacy shutter, Acer thought to include a slim self-adhesive shutter in the package that you can apply if you desire. The display itself is perhaps a little disappointing, being only 1366 by 768, and the contrast and brightness are nothing special. Of note is that the color seems to shift a little bit as you move your head from side to side, but once again, higher quality brings higher prices, and this display is certainly usable. But the largest surprise is that the speakers are surprisingly good given the size and price. There is actually more bass and volume than I expected. As to the included IO, other than the expected BlueTooth and WiFi, it features a single USB-A rated for up to 5Mbps, one 3.5mm audio jack, and a single USB-C port that is used for charging, adding external devices, and can do video out. This computer had no problems driving an external 3440 by 1440 display, if that is the sort of thing that you need. A USB-C power supply is included, but this can use any USB-C charger large enough to drive a laptop. Note that there is nothing inside that is upgradable. Everything is soldered down to the main board. == Performance == They say that it is what is inside that counts, and this does not have much inside, but for many it will be enough. This Chromebook uses a dual-core x86 processor backed up by 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of flash storage. Note that there is no way to expand anything; neither RAM nor SSD. The performance is perfectly OK for light office tasks. Google Docs and Google Sheets both work well, as do the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Sometimes the Firefox browser seemed a little sluggish when starting up or trying to type in a new URL, but they got the job done, even though I had to wait a second or two longer than I was accustomed to. Also inside is a 33 WH battery, which gives around seven hours of life away from a charger with light usage. == Software == The thing about a Chromebook is that it is a Chromebook. You are limited in the apps that you can run. But with that being understood, it can run most Android apps. I had no problems installing Google Docs and Sheets, and Microsoft Teams installed easily, as well as BitWarden password manager. The only issues that I encountered were that I could not install Microsoft Outlook, and the Amazon shopping app (but Amazon Prime Video was not a problem). There is also an option to get a Linux terminal window up, but I am not sure how useful that will be to most people in the market for this type of computer. == Summary == This is a machine with several compromises, but it is built to hit an affordable price point. If you need a Chromebook, and this is a machine that you can afford, then it is worthy of consideration. All of the compromises are acceptable, and none of them are deal-breakers.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars The 311 is the way to go for the entire family Tech Insider Network Member The Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a compact, fast and useful laptop that offers great performance for everyday tasks for everyone in the family due to its portability, let me further explain. The Chromebook 311 has a nice 11.6 inch screen, and it is perfect for movability. It is also lightweight just less than 3 lbs. so it is easy to carry around, either at home, class or maybe at a favorite spot. I like how it feels, it feels sturdy and durable all around and it can withstand minor bumps and drops. It is powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and it has 4GB of RAM, so it easily handles everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, and streaming best of all it does it well. It works great wirelessly, using Wi-Fi connection all around the house it has worked flawlessly. It does have an HD Webcam with dual built in speakers so our kids can take an online class or just to communicate with others, and it does come with a webcam cover for privacy. Another thing we like about the Chromebook is its good battery life. It can last up to 8 hours on a single charge and that is plenty for most people including our kids at home as well as us adults. Since the Chromebook runs on Chrome OS, it is like having my Android cell phone with a bigger screen, keyboard and touchpad which they are responsive and comfortable to use by the way. The system is easy to use and I can access my Google Drive, Google Docs as well as other applications from the Google App store. Overall, the Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a great choice for family like ours, that we can share it since it is very portable and reliable for everyday use. Now that the kids have recently returned to school, they are ready to use the Chromebook too.Read More Posted 2 months ago by AngelM

Rated 5 out of 5 stars Basic but very capable and portable. Tech Insider Network Member Top 250 Contributor I am quite pleased with the newest Acer 311. The build quality is decent despite being all plastic. That makes it lighter and more portable. The screen can lay 180° flat, stays up, and does not wobble. The keys have very good travel and feel very tactile. The trackpad is plastic but has a nice feel and is clicky. The bezels are bigger than I’d prefer, making the 11.6” display seem smaller. The HD (1366 x 768) screen has acceptable brightness but is a bit washed out and has pretty bad viewing angles. Nevertheless, I can see all text, graphics, and vide clearly. Sadly, there is no touchscreen support. The sound is what you’d expect from a small laptop. OK volume, clear, but no bass whatsoever. About connectivity, we have a USB-C 3.2 and a USB-A 3.1 port. The USB-C doubles as a power delivery and display port. The laptop is Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth compatible and works well and fast. There’s also a 3.8mm audio headphone jack. The N4500 CPU, Intel UHD Graphics, 4GB LPDDR4X memory combined make for a very smooth Chromebook workflow. I had several internet tabs open, (within reason), watched video, did productivity work, played super-basic games, and yes, streamed games with relatively no issues or slowdown. I did notice the laptop got bit warm but nothing uncomfortable and the fans were not loud at all. The 64GB storage is low but considering that this is designed to be used with cloud support, makes it sufficient. The battery life ranges between 8-10 hours depending on the use -good enough for a full workday. The 720P webcam is nothing to write home about but good enough for those basic video calls. I appreciate the included security cam cover. In the end, I think this Chromebook is quite portable and capable of handling everyday tasks. It’s perfect for student use and for anyone that is looking for simplicity and security. While the price could have been a bit lower, this is a great budget option.Read More Posted 2 months ago by insomniak1

Paragraphs:
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).
As well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration.
Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data.
Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server.
There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
After the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.
In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, JumpStation was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot.
In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.
Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions.
The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).
Static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using socket programming.
Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[3] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.
By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as Xpath can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.
There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of ""bots"" for specific verticals with no ""man in the loop"" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
The pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[4] are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[5]
Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning. This method enables more intelligent and flexible data extraction, accommodating complex and dynamic web content.
The world of web scraping offers a variety of software tools designed to simplify and customize the process of data extraction from websites. These tools vary in their approach and capabilities, making web scraping accessible to both novice users and advanced programmers.
Some advanced web scraping software can automatically recognize the data structure of a web page, eliminating the need for manual coding. Others provide a recording interface that allows users to record their interactions with a website, thus creating a scraping script without writing a single line of code. Many tools also include scripting functions for more customized extraction and transformation of content, along with database interfaces to store the scraped data locally.
Web scraping tools are versatile in their functionality. Some can directly extract data from APIs, while others are capable of handling websites with AJAX-based dynamic content loading or login requirements. Point-and-click software, for instance, empowers users without advanced coding skills to benefit from web scraping. This democratizes access to data, making it easier for a broader audience to leverage the power of web scraping.
Some platforms provide not only tools for web scraping but also opportunities for developers to share and potentially monetize their scraping solutions. By leveraging these tools and platforms, users can unlock the full potential of web scraping, turning raw data into valuable insights and opportunities.
[6]
The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[7]
In the United States, website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA""), and (3) trespass to chattel.[8] However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.
U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of ""scrapers"" or ""robots"" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[9][10] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[11]
One of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[12] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[13]
Southwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of ""Computer Fraud and Abuse"" and has led to ""Damage and Loss"" and ""Unauthorized Access"" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes ""Interference with Business Relations"", ""Trespass"", and ""Harmful Access by Computer"". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as ""Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment"", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[14] In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in Craigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[15]
While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[16] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[17] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly ""excessively crawled"" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[18] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.
In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[19]
In Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[20][21] In Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.
The Ninth Circuit ruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA in hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in Van Buren v. United States which narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[22] On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[23]
Internet Archive collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.[citation needed]
In February 2006, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[24]
In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law. In the case of Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland's High Court ruled Ryanair's ""click-wrap"" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[25] The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[26]
On April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[27] The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[28]
In Australia, the Spam Act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[29][30]
Leaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate the Information Technology Act, 2000, which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource.

Popular Web Scraping Tools
BeautifulSoup: A Python library that provides simple methods for extracting data from HTML and XML files.
Scrapy: An open-source and collaborative web crawling framework for Python that allows you to extract the data, process it, and store it.
Octoparse: A no-code web scraping tool that offers a user-friendly interface for extracting data from websites without needing programming skills.
ParseHub: Another no-code web scraper that can handle dynamic content and works with AJAX-loaded sites.
Apify: A platform that offers a wide range of scraping tools and the ability to create custom scrapers.
InstantAPI.ai: An AI-powered tool that transforms any web page into personalized APIs instantly, offering advanced data extraction and customization.
Blocking an IP address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and DNSRBL. This will also block all browsing from that address.
Disabling any web service API that the website's system might expose.
Bots sometimes declare who they are (using user agent strings) and can be blocked on that basis using robots.txt; 'googlebot' is an example. Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.
Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic
Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a CAPTCHA. Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges. They can be triggered because the bot is: 1) making too many requests in a short time, 2) using low-quality proxies, or 3) not covering the web scraper’s fingerprint properly.[31]
Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well. However, many such solutions are not very effective.[32]
Locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.
Obfuscation using CSS sprites to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses, at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users.
Because bots rely on consistency in the front-end code of a target website, adding small variations to the HTML/CSS surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process.
Websites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the robots.txt file and allow partial access, limit the crawl rate, specify the optimal time to crawl and more.

Paragraphs:

Wikipedia[c] is a free content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history,[3][4] and is consistently ranked among the ten most visited websites; as of August 2024[update], it was ranked fourth by Semrush,[5] and seventh by Similarweb.[6] Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[7]
Initially only available in English, editions of Wikipedia in more than 300 other languages have been developed. The English Wikipedia, with its over 6.9 million articles, is the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 63 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024[update].[W 1] In July 2024, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic was from the United States, followed by Japan at 6.2%, the United Kingdom at 5.8%, Russia at 5.2%, Germany at 5%, and the remaining 51% split among other countries.[8]
Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, and culture. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[9][10] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward[3][11][12] while becoming an important fact-checking site.[13][14] Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]
Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[19] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[20] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[W 2] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[22][W 3] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[W 4] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.[W 5]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001[20] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[W 6] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[22] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[23][24] Its integral policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[W 7] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[22] Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.[25]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[W 8][W 9] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[26]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[W 10] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[27][W 11]
After an early period of exponential growth,[28] the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[29] The edition reached 3 million articles in August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[W 12] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to ""increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits"".[28] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[30][31][32]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[33][34] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[35] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.[36] Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".[37] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, ""The Decline of Wikipedia"", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[38] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[39] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.""[40] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[41][42]
In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks.[43] With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).[43] This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.[44] In 2014, it received 8 billion page views every month.[W 13] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ""according to the ratings firm comScore"".[45] As of March 2023[update], it ranked 6th in popularity, according to Similarweb.[46] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".[47][48]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.[49] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.[50][W 14]
In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia;[51] in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument;[52] and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.[53] In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.[54][55] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.[56]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it ""had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.""[57] Varma added, ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.""[57] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].""[57] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[58] As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[59] from which cloud computing was the most cited page.[60]
On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called ""Vector 2022"".[61][62] It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.[62][W 15] The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.[61][63]
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.[64]
Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[W 16] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.[W 17][65] A frequently vandalized article can be ""semi-protected"" or ""extended confirmed protected"", meaning that only ""autoconfirmed"" or ""extended confirmed"" editors can modify it.[W 17] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes.[W 18] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as ""perhaps the most important"" means at its disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".[66]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[W 19] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.[67] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[68] However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversity the editing community.[69]
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.[e][70] On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.[W 20] ""New pages patrol"" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[W 21]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".[71]
Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.[72] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.[W 22]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.[73][74] However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.[75]
In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[75] It remained uncorrected for four months.[75] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[76][77] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".[75] The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[78]
Wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".[W 23][79] It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,[80] and criticized as creating a competitive[81] and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles.[82][83] Research has focused on, for example, impoliteness of disputes,[84][85] the influence of rival editing camps,[86][87] the conversational structure,[88] and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources.[89][90]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.[91][92] Yasseri contended that simple reverts or ""undo"" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on ""mutually reverting edit pairs"", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism, and Muhammad.[92] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[92] In 2020, researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia.[93]
Editors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia, with roughly 500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies.[94]
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.[W 24][W 25] By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.[W 26][W 27] In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the ""official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation"".[W 28]
The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the ""Five pillars"", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.[W 29] The five pillars are:
The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.[95] Editors can enforce the rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.[W 30] Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[W 19]
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[W 31] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.[W 32] Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[W 33] It must not present original research.[W 34] A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.[W 31] Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[W 35] This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.[96] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[W 36] As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.[97]
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[98][99] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[W 37]
Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for ""adminship"",[100] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[W 38] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[W 38]
By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.[101] In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.[102]
Wikipedia has delegated some administrative functions to bots, such as when granting privileges to human editors. Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors.[97]
Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".[W 23]
Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field.[103] Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers.[103]: 62  A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.[103]: 83 
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.[104] Statistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[105] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.[104]
Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).[f] Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).[104] Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.[W 39] When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.[104]
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated ""talk"" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.[108] Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".[W 40]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[109] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?"" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[110] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".[111] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.""[112] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[113]
The English Wikipedia has 6,905,069 articles, 48,204,582 registered editors, and 120,034 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.[W 41] Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".[114] Editors who do not log in are in some sense ""second-class citizens"" on Wikipedia,[114] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[115] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.[115]
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".[116] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.""[111] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".[111]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[117] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[118] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".[119]
Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[120] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[121] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[121] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".[122] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[123]
Distribution of the 63,891,853 articles in different language editions (as of November 2, 2024)[W 42]
There are currently 339 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of November 2024, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, German, French, Swedish, and Dutch Wikipedias.[W 43] The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013[update] had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Waray, Arabic, and Portuguese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Indonesian, Serbian, Korean, Norwegian, and Turkish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.[W 44][W 43] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.9 million articles. As of January 2021,[update] the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.[W 45]
Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[W 46] or points of view.[W 47]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.[W 48][125]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".[W 49] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[W 50] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[W 51] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[W 52] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[W 52] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[W 32]
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer ""interwiki links"", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.[127][W 53]
A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English Wikipedia.[126]
On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled ""The Future of Wikipedia"", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that ""the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.""[128] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.[128]
In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[128]
Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.[update][129][103] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of ""truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods"".[130] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's ""undue-weight policy"", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[131][132][133]
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an ""ax to grind"" on the topic.[130][134] A 2008 article in Education Next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.[135] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that ""Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.""[136]
Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much ""leftist bias"".[137] Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a ""propaganda"" for the left-leaning ""establishment"" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.[138] In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.[139] Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a ""western cultural bias"" (or ""pro-western bias"")[140] or ""Eurocentric bias"",[141] reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, ""similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography"". Carwil Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship [142] and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a ""decolonization"" of Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors.[143]
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[144] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that ""the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.""[145] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects ""a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors"" in science articles, ""Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.""[146]
Others raised similar critiques.[147] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,[148][149] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.[150] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a ""flawed study design"" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study ""statistical power"" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).[151]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia ""makes no guarantee of validity"" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[W 54] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information,[152] vandalism, and similar problems. Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a ""general source"" that ""can be a real boon"" in ""coming up to speed in the law governing a situation"" and, ""while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources"".[153]
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia."" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[154] Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, ""the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created"".[155] In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that: ""There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is]."" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopædia Britannica, summarizing that ""...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.""[156]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[157] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[158] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[159] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of ""fake news"" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[160]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.[70][W 55] In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[162] The article stated that: ""Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'""[162][163][164][165][166] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[167]
Some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[168] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[169][170] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[171] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. ""For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia"", he said.[172][173]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[174] In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything"".[175]
A 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education ""flipped classroom"", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.[176]
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled ""Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia"", stated that ""Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.""[177] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.[177] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled ""Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?"", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: ""Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.""[178] Beck added that: ""Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.""[178]
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[W 56] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[179][180] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[W 57] The ""Wikipedia is not censored"" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.[181] The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[182] and Pakistan,[183] among other countries.[184][185][186]
Through its ""Wikipedia Loves Libraries"" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[187] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the ""people and arts"" category, while males focus more on ""geography and science"".[188]
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.[189] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.[190]
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.[191] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.[123]
Academic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the ""average Wikipedian"", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15–49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[192] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[193][194] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[195][196] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[193]
Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.[195] In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example ""biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare"".[37] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[38]
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.[197] Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.[W 58] The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.[W 59]
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a ""blacklist"" it supplies to British internet service providers.[198]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[199][200] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted ""obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children"", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[201] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[201] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[202]
Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[203] saying that Wikipedia did not have ""material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.""[203] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".[204] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[205]
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a ""private citizen"" rather than a ""public figure"" in the eyes of the law.[206][g] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, ""we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement"", and states that ""personal information"" may be shared ""For legal reasons"", ""To Protect You, Ourselves & Others"", or ""To Understand & Experiment"".[W 60]
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka ""Tron"", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.[207]
Wikipedia has a "" Volunteer Response Team"" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS[W 61] to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.[W 62]
In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.[208]
Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.[209][210] The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.[211] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[212]
In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media.[W 63][213] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics ""for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics"", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[213][214] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard Mourou.[213] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that ""it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.""[215] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[215]
A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. ""Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.""[216]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.[W 64] The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[217][W 65] The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.[W 66]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[W 67] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, ""Information, like air, wants to be free.""[218][219] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who ""said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities"", Walsh said.[218]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the ""superprotection"" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,[W 68] Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[W 69] Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: ""It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.""[122]
Maher served as executive director until April 2021.[220] Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.[221]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.[W 70]
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.[W 71] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.[W 72] MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.[W 71][W 73] Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.[W 74] Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[W 75] In April 2005, a Lucene extension[W 76][W 77] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch.[W 78] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[222][223][224] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as ""slow and buggy"".[225] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[W 79]
Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[W 80][226][227] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[228] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[W 81] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[226] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[229] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[W 82] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[230]
As of 2021,[update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server.[W 83] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.[W 83] The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.[231]
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system.[W 84] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.[W 85][232] In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[W 86] In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France.[W 87] As of February 2023,[update] caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore, and Marseille.[W 25][W 88]
Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[38] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[233] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the ""Thank"" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[38][225] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[234] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,[W 89] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[234] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,[W 90] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[234]
Multiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.[235][236] The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects.[W 91]
The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.[237][238] Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said ""By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.""[239]
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[W 24] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.[240] In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[W 92] Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.[W 93] In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[W 94][W 95][W 96][W 97]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine,[W 98] while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.[W 99] Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[241] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.[242][243]
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.[W 100] The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.
Thousands of ""mirror sites"" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com.[244][245] Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.[W 101] Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset)[246] and DuckDuckGo.
Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.[W 102] The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,[W 103] the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,[W 104] and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.[W 105] Additionally, ""Wikipedia for Schools"", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.[W 106]
There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[247][W 107] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.[248]
The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.[249] Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF.[W 108] As of February 2023,[update] it has over 101 million items.[W 109] WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.[W 110]
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[W 111] Wikipedia publishes ""dumps"" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,[update] there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[W 112] Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this.[250]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[251]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, ""Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."" In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned ""a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile"", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the ""worry"" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[45] By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.[7]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.[W 101] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices.[W 113] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.[252][253]
The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[W 114][W 115] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[W 116] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[W 117][254] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[W 117]
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[255][256] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[255] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[38] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[255][256]
Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015.[16][257][258] This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.[259]
In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[13][14] Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, ""YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.""[14][260]
In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating ""With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.""[45] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[261] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[262]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[W 118] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[263] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[W 119] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[264] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[265]
According to ""Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011"", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[W 120] As of February 2023,[update] Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.[W 1]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[266][267][268][269] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, ""Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.""[267] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.[270] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.[update][271][272]
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[W 121][273][274] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the ""related links"" section of its ""further reading"" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[275] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[276]—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[277] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[278] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[279] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[280][281] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[282][283][284][285]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[286] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: ""Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.""[287] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled ""Wikipedia page the latest status symbol"", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[288]
One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, ""the seventh most consulted website"", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[289]
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia ""the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth"".[290][291]
In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as ""one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web"" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having ""since colonized the web for television's values"". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers ""endangered"" due to the ""gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment"". Rather than ""sapere aude"" (lit. 'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of ""dare not to care to know"". This is while Wikipedia faces ""a more concerning problem"" than funding, namely ""a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website"". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to ""save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.""[292]
Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[W 122] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the ""community"" category.[293]
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question ""Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?""[294]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.[295]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[296] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.[297] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.[298]
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning ""together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on"".[167] Another example can be found in ""Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence"", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[299] as well as the 2010 The Onion article ""'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today"".[300]
In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[301] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[302]
""My Number One Doctor"", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.[303]
In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named ""Professor Wikipedia"", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[304] The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying ""Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.""[305] In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[306] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[307]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: ""Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?""[308] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.[309]
In June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title ""Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday"" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level.[310]
Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[W 123] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,[311] Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,[W 124] Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,[W 125] Wikinews, for collaborative journalism,[W 126] and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[W 127] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing.[312] In 2012, Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide,[313] and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.[W 128]
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[314][315][316] Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay ""The amorality of Web 2.0"" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because ""free trumps quality all the time"". Carr wrote, ""Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.""[317] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the ""wisdom of crowds"" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.[318]
Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping ""far more sharply"".[319] Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, ""The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?""[319]
Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing.[320][321] In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called ""wikification"",[322] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.[323] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find ""missing"" links in Wikipedia.[324]
In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[325][326][327] They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms ""followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)"".[327][328] The study was updated in 2019.[329]
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia ""at least a dozen times a day"", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as ""a work of reference as useful as any in existence"", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[330]
A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[331][332] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence[291] to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism[333][334] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.[335][336]
In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.[337]
Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[338]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[339] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[W 129] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[340]
Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium.[341][342] The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[343][344]

^ Sanger, Larry (December 31, 2004). ""Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism"". Kuro5hin, Op–Ed. Archived from the original on November 1, 2021. Retrieved March 26, 2021. There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry ""censorship"", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.)

Paragraphs:
On Wikipedia, trusted users may be appointed as administrators (also referred to as admins, sysops or janitors),[1]: 327  following a successful request for adminship. Currently, there are 847 administrators on the English Wikipedia.[2] Administrators have additional technical privileges compared with other editors, such as being able to protect and delete pages and being able to block users from editing pages.
On Wikipedia, becoming an administrator is often referred to as ""being given [or taking up] the mop"",[3] a term which has also been used elsewhere.[4] In 2006, The New York Times reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were ""geographically diverse"".[5] In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was ""running out of administrators"", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed administrators each month, but in the first half of 2012, only nine in total were appointed.[6][7]
However, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder, denied that this was a crisis or that Wikipedia was running out of admins, saying, ""The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on.""[8] Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is ""not a big deal"", and that ""It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.""[9]
In his 2008 book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual, John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role.[10] Instead, he says, admins usually ""delete pages"" and ""protect pages involved in edit wars"".[10] Wikipedia administrators are not employees or agents of the Wikimedia Foundation.[11]
While the first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales in October 2001,[12] administrator privileges on Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA).[1] Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be ""akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court"" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, ""It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point"", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was ""prove you weren't a bozo"".[6]
Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after ""extensive work on the wiki"".[1] While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision that can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a ""request"" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators.[13] This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et al. quoted that ""Prior to mid-2005, RfAs typically did not attract much attention. Since then, it has become quite common for RfAs to attract huge numbers of RfA groupies who all support one another"",[14] with the record number of votes in one RfA as of May 2022 being 468 for the RfA of longtime editor Tamzin Hadasa Kelly, which was supported by 340 users and opposed by 116 amidst controversy over their criticism of supporters of Donald Trump.[15]
Once granted administrator privileges, a user has access to additional functions in order to perform certain duties.[6] These include ""messy cleanup work"",[1] deletion of articles deemed unsuitable, protecting pages (restricting editing privileges to that page),[16]: 66  and blocking the accounts of disruptive users.[1][6] Blocking a user must be done according to Wikipedia's policies and a reason must be stated for the block, which will be permanently logged by the software.[1]: 401 [16]: 120  Use of this privilege to ""gain editing advantages"" is considered inappropriate.[1]
A 2013 scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors.[17] This corresponds to a modality of plural voting. Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007, with the goal of determining which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's Guide to requests for adminship[18] were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin.[4] In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw, which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. They found that they could ""classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates.""[19]

Harris and Trump Battle to the Wire in Swing States, Times/Siena Polls Find
Donald Trump has improved his standing in Pennsylvania even as late-deciding voters appear to be breaking for Kamala Harris.

Some Surprises in Last Battleground Polls, but Still Pointing to Deadlock
The race remains essentially even across the seven states likeliest to decide the presidency.

A Deeper Look at the Numbers
Ruth Igielnik
The gender gap continues to be massive this election. Harris is winning women by 16 percentage points in battleground states while Trump wins men by the same margin. For the first time, abortion is the most important issue for women in deciding their vote. For men, the economy is the top concern.
Ruth Igielnik
Harris is winning young voters by 17 percentage points in battleground states. That is a substantial improvement over Joe Biden’s standing with young voters earlier this year. But Harris still slightly lags Biden’s 2020 numbers with young voters, many of whom are struggling to decide up until the end.
Lisa Lerer
There are still voters to be persuaded, even at this late hour in the race. The poll shows that 11 percent of voters remained undecided, down from 16 percent about a month ago.
Ruth Igielnik
The poll finds that in some states nearly half of voters have already voted. Harris is winning those voters in six of the seven states, while Trump is winning them in Arizona.
Ruth Igielnik
All eyes are on Pennsylvania, where Trump and Harris are deadlocked. The last three Times/Siena polls had Harris +4 in the state, suggesting the race has narrowed significantly in the state that might be key to victory for either candidate.
Maya King
Harris has a slight edge over Trump in Georgia. Her campaign has invested millions in the state in the hopes of building on Biden’s narrow 2020 win in the state. Harris rallied thousands near downtown Atlanta yesterday.
Katie Glueck
Harris and Trump are deadlocked in Michigan, a crucial battleground state that Biden won in 2020 and Trump won in 2016. Harris is campaigning in Michigan today, while Trump has a rally scheduled in Grand Rapids tomorrow night.
Jennifer Medina
Harris is narrowly ahead of Trump in Nevada. Democrats have been anxiously analyzing early voting patterns in the state and are now relying on a heavy turnout in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the majority of the state’s Democrats.
Jonathan Swan
The final batch of public polls has set off a round of late second-guessing among some Trump allies. But Trump’s core team remains convinced that these public polls are underestimating his support and that he is on track to win.

Paragraphs:
Fake news refers to false or misleading information which masquerades as legitimate news. Generally, fake news falls into two categories:
Misinformation isn’t a new phenomenon – the term “fake news” was actually used in the 19th century – but the internet and soI don’cial media have transformed how it’s created and spread. Pre-internet, people tended to receive their news from trusted media sources whose journalists were required to follow strict codes of practice. The internet enabled new ways to publish, share and consume news and information, with relatively little regulation or editorial standards. Many people now consume news from social media and other online sources – but it’s not always easy to determine which stories are credible and which are false.
There are different types of fake news, depending on the motivation of those who create it. For example:
Sensationalism sells, and outrageous or weird stories and distorted images drive clicks and shares online. Clickbait refers to stories deliberately designed to get more website visitors and increase advertising revenue for the website owners – often at the expense of truth and accuracy.
This refers to false or distorted stories written to mislead audiences and promote a political agenda or biased perspective.
Sometimes, journalists don’t have time to check all their facts before publishing, leading to genuine mistakes becoming fake news. However, trusted new sources will correct errors in their stories and be transparent with readers when they’ve got things wrong.
Sometimes a story may be broadly true, but a sensationalist or misleading headline is used to entice readers to click on it. This can lead to fake news – since usually only the headline and small snippets of the article are displayed on social media, where it can quickly spread.
This is when genuine news sources are impersonated with false, made-up stories to deceive or mislead audiences.
Some fake news is published for entertainment value. For example, satirical stories use humor, irony, or exaggeration to joke about the news or famous people. These stories don't attempt to mislead audiences because they aren't meant to be taken seriously. Notable examples of satirical websites include The Onion and The Daily Mash.
High-profile politicians have been known to dismiss stories they disagree with – which may be factual and verified – as “fake news”. Because the term “fake news” is expansive and means different things to different people, it can be contested. In 2018, the British Government banned the term from official papers or documents, claiming it was too poorly defined to be meaningful. Instead, it prefers to use the terms ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation"" when describing false stories:
Fake news is often spread through fake news websites, which, in an attempt to gain credibility, often emulate authentic news sources. According to research, social media enables false claims to spread quickly – more quickly, in fact, than real news. Fake news spreads rapidly because it’s typically designed to grab attention and appeal to emotions – which is why it often features outlandish claims or stories which provoke anger or fear.
Social media feeds often prioritize content based on engagement metrics – that is, how often it’s shared and liked – rather than how accurate or well-researched it is. This approach can allow clickbait, hyperbole, and misinformation to spread widely. Social media companies are seen as platforms rather than publishers, which means they don’t have the same legal liabilities as traditional media outlets – although this may change as the political and legal landscape evolves.
Social media bots can spread fake news since they mass produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of their sources. Bots can create fake accounts online, which then gain followers, recognition, and authority – some of which are programmed to spread misinformation.
Trolls – internet users who deliberately try to start arguments or upset people – also play a part in spreading fake news. Sometimes they can be paid to do so for political reasons. The terms “troll farm” or “troll factory” are sometimes used in this context to refer to institutionalized groups of trolls who attempt to interfere in political decision-making.
Fake news sometimes involves the use of Deepfakes. These are fake videos created using digital software, machine learning, and face-swapping. Images are combined to create new footage which shows events or actions that never actually took place. The results can be very convincing and difficult to identify as false.
Coronavirus fake news
The Covid-19 pandemic provided fertile ground for false information online, with numerous examples of fake news throughout the crisis. A persistent example of fake news in social media was the claim that 5G technology was linked to the spread of the virus – supposedly because 5G suppressed the immune system while the virus communicated through radio waves. These claims were not true and were repeatedly debunked by official sources but were still shared extensively.
US presidential election in 2016
Fake news and misinformation became a big issue during the US election in 2016, with false and misleading claims across the political spectrum. One analysis suggested that a large proportion of fake news generated in the election was created by teenagers in Macedonia, who found the more hyper-partisan stories they created, the more people clicked through and shared, and the more money they made as a result.
Boston Marathon bombing
In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, false claims that the bombing was an elaborate ruse plotted by the US government circulated online. In the wake of many terrorist events across the world, conspiracy theories are often rife. The notion that they are ""false flag"" operations – i.e., carried out by the state or a secret cabal to pin the blame on others or provide cover for other activities – is a common trope.
Kim Jong-un – the sexiest man alive?
In 2012, satirical website The Onion ran an article claiming that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un had been voted the sexiest man alive, declaring that ""the Pyongyang-bred heartthrob is every woman's dream come true."" In an example of how satire can sometimes be misunderstood across cultures, publications in China – including the online version of China's Communist Party newspaper – reported the claim as though it were true.
People often make important decisions – for example, how to vote in an election or what medical treatment to follow when they’re ill – based on what they read in the news. That’s why trusted news is so important. The dangers of fake news include:
You may be wondering how to identify fake news on Facebook and other social media sites? As a student, how to avoid fake news? Or how to avoid accidentally sharing misinformation online? Here are ten tips to identify misinformation, recognize fake news websites, and think before you share:
1. Check the source:
Check the web address for the page you're looking at. Sometimes, fake news sites may have spelling errors in the URL or use less conventional domain extensions such as "".infonet"" or "".offer"". If you are unfamiliar with the site, look in the About Us section.
2. Check the author:
Research them to see if they are credible – for example, are they real, do they have a good reputation, are they writing about their specific area of expertise, and do they have a particular agenda? Consider what the writer’s motivation might be.
3. Check other sources:
Are other reputable news or media outlets reporting on the story? Are credible sources cited within the story? Professional global news agencies have editorial guidelines and extensive resources for fact-checking, so if they are also reporting the story, that’s a good sign.
4. Maintain a critical mindset:
A lot of fake news is cleverly written to provoke strong emotional reactions such as fear or anger. Maintain a critical mindset by asking yourself – why has this story been written? Is it promoting a particular cause or agenda? Is it trying to make me click through to another website?
5. Check the facts:
Credible news stories will include plenty of facts – data, statistics, quotes from experts, and so on. If these are missing, question why. Reports with false information often contain incorrect dates or altered timelines, so it’s a good idea to check when the article was published. Is it a current or old news story?
6. Check the comments:
Even if the article or video is legitimate, the comments below may not be. Often links or comments posted in response to content can be autogenerated by bots or people hired to put our misleading or confusing information.
7. Check your own biases:
We all have biases – could these be influencing the way you respond to the article? Social media can create echo chambers by suggesting stories that match your existing browsing habits, interests, and opinions. The more we read from diverse sources and perspectives, the more likely it is that we can draw accurate conclusions.
8. Check whether it’s a joke:
Satirical websites are popular, and sometimes it is not always clear whether a story is just a joke or parody. Check the website to see if it’s known for satire or creating funny stories.
9. Check images are authentic:
Images you see on social media could have been edited or manipulated. Possible signs include warping – where straight lines in the background now appear wavy – as well as strange shadows, jagged edges, or skin tone that looks too perfect. Bear in mind, too, that an image may be accurate but simply used in a misleading context. You can use tools such as Google’s Reverse Image Search to check where an image originates from and whether it has been altered.
10. Use a fact-checking site:
Some of the best known include:
Fake news relies on believers reposting, retweeting, or otherwise sharing false information. If you're not sure whether an article is authentic or not, pause and think before you share. To help stay safe online, use an antivirus solution like Kaspersky Total Security, which protects you from hackers, viruses, malware, and other online threats.

Deliberately inaccurate stories – that is, the people publishing them know them to be false but publish them anyway. This might be to manipulate public opinion or to drive traffic to a specific website.
Stories that contain elements of truth but are broadly inaccurate. This might be because the writer hasn’t checked all their facts or has exaggerated certain aspects to make a particular point.
Disinformation– fake or misleading stories created and shared deliberately, often by a writer who might have a financial or political motive to do so.
Misinformation – this also means fake or misleading stories, but in this case, the stories may not have been deliberately created or shared with the intention to mislead.
When people can’t distinguish between real and fake news, it creates confusion and misunderstanding about important social and political issues. When people have a generalized sense of ""you can't believe anything you read,"" it undermines overall trust in legitimate news sources.
Fake and misleading stories relating to medical treatments or major diseases – such as cancer or Covid-19 – could lead to individuals making misinformed decisions about their health.
A lot of fake news is designed to stir up and intensify social conflict. When different sides of an argument have their own ‘facts’, it leads to greater polarization within societies and can affect electoral outcomes.
Universities and colleges expect students to use quality sources of information for assignments. Students who use sources with false or misleading information could receive lower grades.

Every artist needs an artboard, brush, palette, paint, and a vision to create the beautiful art we all love.
…or, in some cases, have no choice but to love.

Like artists, designers also require specific tools to create engaging design systems people can interact with.
One that you’ve probably heard of is Figma – a cloud-based design tool.
Let’s cut to the chase!
To get started on Figma, you need to have an account. So, let’s open one together.
First, go to www.figma.com and click the Get Started button at the top right corner to sign up. If you have an account with them already, click the Log in button instead.

Since this is a tutorial, we’ll go with the sign-up option. For that, Figma gives you two choices.

Click the Continue with Google button or enter your email and preferred password. You’ll also be asked to input your name, specify the kind of work you do, and how you intend to use Figma.
Then, click the Create account button. You’ll be sent a verification email almost immediately. Open the message and tap Verify email, and you’re all set.
Now, you should have access to a dashboard that looks like this:

Creating new projects
To create projects in Figma, you must be part of a team. If you already are, just join them and open their file browser. But if you don’t, click the Create new team button on the left side of the page and enter a team name. Then invite collaborators you’d like to work with you on the project.

After you’ve created a team, you’ll be taken to the team’s page. From there, you can create a new project.
So let’s do that!
Click on the New project button on the top right side of your team’s file page. Enter a name for the project if you’re on Figma’s Pro plan or select the Team project box to proceed if you’re on the free plan.

Voila! You’ve created a new project.
You can only create one project and three designs with the Free plan. But with the Pro plan, you can access unlimited projects and designs.
Adding a design file
Design files house the design you want to work on, and they can be added to the project’s environment.

Just tap the New design file button, and you’ll be redirected to a new page that shows the Figma file like this. 👇

You can give your design file a name when you first create it. The default name is ‘Untitled,’ but you can tap on it to change it, so it’s more descriptive.
Explore Figma templates
Figma has a database of templates you can customize for your UX designs. To access them, head back to the project folder and select See all. It’s just under the New Design button you clicked on earlier.

Now that your Figma account is set up let’s start creating new frames for your design.
Frames are like boards on Figma. They represent the interface end users of the design will interact with. You can select different frames on Figma in which to place your design.
To create new frames, open the design file and click the Frame tool in the top left-hand corner. Having trouble finding it? Look for the button that looks like a hashtag. You can also create new frames by pressing the letter F on your keyboard.

Choosing a frame size
Once you’ve selected the frame tool, go to the left side of the page. Pick a frame from the selections available, and it’ll appear on the canvas. Available frame sizes include most iPhones and Androids.
For this tutorial, let’s select the Surface Pro 8 frame:

If you need a frame different from the ones available, you can draw your own by clicking and dragging the mouse.
Editing a frame’s properties
After selecting a frame, you’ll see a panel under Design on the right side of the page. There you can assign different properties to the frame as you see fit.
For example, you can change the frame size by typing in your desired pixel size in the X, Y, W, and H columns.
Other things you can do include filling the frame with color using Fill, adding effects by clicking Effects, and more.
Using layers
On the left side of the screen is the Layers panel. Each time you add a new element or frame, a new layer is added. You can rearrange them by dragging and dropping them.
You can also group layers to have a more organized file if you want to move them across different frames. To group layers, select all the elements. Press Ctrl+G if you’re a Windows user or CMD+G on a Mac.
Vector shapes
If you want to use basic shapes (rectangle, circle, etc.), pick the square sign from the top of the page.
For more complex shapes, icons, logos, or buttons, select the pen icon from the top menu or press P on your keyboard.

With it, you can click anywhere on the frame to create the kind of shape you have in mind. Then, press Enter when you’re done.
If you want to modify the vector shape when designing, you can do so via the Properties menu on the right-hand side of the page.
What’s a design without pictures? Here’s how you add them on Figma!
There are different ways to insert images into your frame on Figma. The most popular and simplest way is to drag and drop them into your work area.
You can also click the Shape menu at the top of the page and select Place image/video.

When you click Open, a dialogue box will open, where you can select the images you want to use. Then, click OK to insert the pictures.
Alternatively, press CMD+Shift+K or Ctrl+Shift+K, to open the dialogue box.
If the image you want to use is from another place on Figma, select the image and press CMD+C or Ctrl+C. Head over to the frame you want to use and press CMD+V or Ctrl+V.
But what if you want to insert the image into a different shape or frame?
To do that, click on the frame. Select Fill from the Properties menu on the right side of the work area if you want to add color.
You’ll see a drop-down menu at the top-left of the color wheel: click it and select Image or Videos.

To choose an image, hover your cursor on the smaller window with black and white colors and click Choose Image.

A dialogue box will pop up so you can pick the images you want. Click Open to insert them into the shape or frame.
If you want, you can edit the picture with the different parameters shown in the small window.
To insert objects, click the square shape icon from the top menu to draw polygons, stars, arrows, lines, rectangles, and ellipses.

Select any shape, click on the frame, and drag it to your preferred size. For a shape with equal proportions, press down the shift key while you draw.
Adding text on Figma is pretty straightforward too.
Just click the T sign and tap on where you want the text on the frame to draw a text box. Then, start typing.
To edit the text, click the text layer and double-click on the text to edit. You can also edit it from the Properties menu. There, you’ll be able to change the text’s color, font, and even edit the words in the content section.
Now, if you’re working on multiple design projects using Figma, wouldn’t it be great to have saved styles that you could simply add to each project?
To learn how to save styles, keep reading!
By saving your styles, you can avoid having to redo the same design process over and over again.

For example, if you want the text headings of your design to have the same font, color, and size, you can create a style and save it as a reusable H2 style.
Then, apply that style to the corresponding headings.
Here’s how to create a text style:
To use the style, select the text you want formatted and click on the style icon to select it.
Text isn’t the only style you can save. Aside from text, you can also save colors, grids, and even effects.
As we saw earlier, saved styles can help you reuse colors or effects in future projects. To do that, you’ll need to:
You can follow the same steps when adding the text style to text whenever you need to reuse the saved templates.
There’s just one tiny drawback with saving a style; it’ll only be available on the file you’re working on.
So, what if you wanna use the styles on other project files? You’ll have to publish it to your team library. Here’s how:

That’s about it for saving styles. This should help you save time when brainstorming, wireframing, or designing.
To further simplify this process, you might want to consider adding reusable components to your design workflow.
Don’t worry, we’ll unpack what it means and how to add them in the next section.
Components are collections of UI elements, objects, or layers that you can repeatedly use across your design. They make it easy to maintain a consistent design to update or scale your work without stress.
Let’s assume you’re working on web design and want the logo and name of the brand to appear across the site.
Those are different elements that you can reuse. You could add both to a component and title it ‘brand logo.’ Then, add it to other frames.
Follow these steps when adding components:
You’ll notice that both layers will be fused into a single layer with the new name: ‘Component 1.’ You can rename it by double-clicking on the name.
This refers to the use of iterations of the components in your design that are not in the initial component.
To create a component icon, click on the Assets panel, the tab next to the Layers menu on the left side of the page.
Select and drag the component’s name to the canvas, creating an instance. You can edit the component icon, which won’t reflect on the original.

Like styles, you can save components for other files or projects.
Click anywhere on the canvas and select the down arrow beside the file’s name at the top of the page.
From the drop-down menu, click Publish library and follow the on-screen instructions to publish the component to the team library.
This feature, however, is only available to Pro or Enterprise users.
Still, in simplifying your processes, there’s another thing you can do…
Auto layout is a function that lets you create a dynamic frame that expands or contracts when you change the content inside it.
This will help you avoid having to adjust the frame repeatedly. It also lets you see whether your design works in real life with a single click.
To begin, change layers to auto layouts:

As you change the content, the box automatically resizes.
Nested auto layouts
Figma also lets you nest auto layouts, meaning you can have a frame within a frame for a more attractive user interface or UI design.
To nest auto layouts, you should have multiple elements or objects you want to merge.
Select them, press shift+A, and you’ll have a nested auto layout.
It should include a parent frame and a child frame.
And that’s about it for auto layouts!
You know how you can take a car you plan on buying for a test drive?
Well, you can do the same for your interface design. But on Figma, it’s referred to as testing prototypes, which we unpack next.
Whether you’re designing a mobile app, landing page, or website, you can test the user experience of either project on Figma’s space in real-time. Testing will help you know what needs to be improved.
To start testing, head over to the Properties menu on the right side of the page. Click the Prototype tab at the top of the panel.
The first thing you’ll likely see is the option to select the device type you want to preview the design on.
If you already selected the device you were designing for when you created the frame, you won’t see that option.

To proceed, click the + sign beside Flow starting point.
It will place a Flow 1 text at the top left corner of the first frame to indicate that as the starting point of the design flow. If you don’t want the selected frame as the first point, right-click the frame’s name and pick Delete starting point.

After selecting the starting point, you must select a hotspot from the starting frame. A hotspot is an area or element users must click to be directed to the next page.
To pick a hotspot, hover over the desired element and see a blue circle by the edge.
When your mouse is directly on the circle, a plus sign will appear. Click and drag the hotspot (+) to connect it to the next screen. It should look like this:

After making the connection, you should see an Interaction details panel.
There you can choose an interaction type for the hotspot. For instance, select On tap if you want the user to tap the hotspot to go to the next page. You can also choose an animation from the menu to show the transition between both screens.
Now, you can make more connections by selecting a hotspot on the second screen that, when users tap it, will link back to the first screen.
When you’re done, you can preview the web or app design by clicking the Play button at the top right corner of the screen.
If you’re comfortable with the final designs, there’s only one step left: invite team members or other stakeholders to collaborate.
Sharing a project with your team, aka developer handoff, is easy on Figma. Just click the Share button at the top right corner of the page.

Then, enter the email of other users or collaborators you want to share it with.
A shortcut is just to copy the link and share it with stakeholders. If you go with this option, update the security setting to Anyone with the link.
***
And with that, we’ve come to the end of this tutorial.
Whew, that was a lot! But we’re confident that you’ve gained a lot from this guide.
Just one more thing, and we can call it a day.
So far, you’ve learned how to use Figma for designs, mockups, and as a prototyping tool.
What you need, in addition to that, is a more streamlined design process that can help you get clear contextual feedback on your visuals.
While Figma allows you to add comments, you can do much more with MarkUp.io.
More specifically, you can optimize reviews, implement feedback, and keep track of the comments as you resolve them.
There’ll also be less confusion for clients who probably won’t get the hang of the design tool you’re using. Feel free to claim a free 30-day trial with MarkUp.io to see for yourself.

Im overwhelmed by the amount of resources there are out there. Some says to learn the subject other to learn tool, some both, ahh so much chores, that i decided to learn the tool but now again there are tons of resources. docs, tutorial, project. am i doing wrong my learning through project? like without understanding spacing,color etc just copying pasting or trying my own idea to do that in figma then learn lets say for that project i required to use gradient so i searched all the way to learn then back to project repeat the process till my project is done.

Am i doing wrong by learning through this method. i feel like i am wasting time by first understanding tool one by one then at last building project for example what is frame and its propetries then at the time of building i dont really remember what i watched or read
Should i switch to my old method of learning through project? whether its fancy project that i know isnt appicable in real life till making cuz its seems interesting not caring much about perfect spacing and guidelines for now, what do you think?

Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that’s taken the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch or Adobe Illustrator, which are standalone applications, Figma can be run entirely from a web browser and, therefore, works not only on Macs but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. It's also free to use!
Another big advantage of Figma is that it allows real-time collaboration on the same file. When using conventional “offline” apps like Sketch and Illustrator, if designers want to share their work, they typically have to export it to an image file and then send it via email or instant message.
In Figma, instead of exporting static images, we can simply share a link to the Figma file for clients and colleagues to open in their browsers. This in itself saves significant time and can streamline a designer’s workflow. But more importantly, it means that clients and colleagues can interact more richly with the work and review the latest version of the file.
This course aims to introduce all of the key functions in Figma. We’ll achieve that by building a set of app screens together. We’ll also use Figma’s prototyping functionality to link the screens together, meaning you can experience how the screens will behave like they would if this were a functional app ready for people to download and use. You’ll be able to share your prototypes with friends, or develop your design further and add it to your portfolio!
Before we get started with today’s lesson, take a sec to work through our quick one-minute goal setting exercise. We want to make sure you’re getting the most out of this course... and that by the end of it you’ve mastered the basics of Figma and accomplished any personal learning goals!
Time to complete: 30 minutes
Getting started in Figma is as simple as going to www.figma.com, clicking “Get started”, entering your details, and completing a quick verification activity. Once you’ve done that, Figma will guide you to a screen with a few more onboarding questions before throwing you right into a project file with some examples of what you can create using Figma .
The look and feel of the Figma interface is quite minimal, but it belies a set of powerful features. Here’s an explanation of the interface’s main areas (labeled above):
Unlike regular desktop design apps, Figma’s menu can be found by clicking the Figma logo in the top-left of the screen. Take a minute to browse around this dropdown and see what’s there! Here, you can also search for specific commands you need. Click on the magnifying glass where it says “Quick actions…” and type in “rectangle” and you’ll quickly find the Rectangle Tool, complete with a handy reminder of its keyboard shortcut (it’s [[R]], by the way).
Here you can quickly access the tools you’re likely to use most often: move, frame, shapes, pen, text, etc. (We’ll cover these tools in the next couple of days!)
This area shows extra options for whatever object you have selected on your canvas. When no object is selected (as shown above), Figma displays the file name.
The right side of the toolbar is where you can find the file sharing functions and see who else is viewing your file in real-time. You’ll also find view and zoom options.
Also known simply as the “left sidebar,” this is where every element in the file is listed and organized into Pages, Frames and Groups.
‍This is where you’ll create all of your designs!
The properties panel offers contextual information and settings for whatever object is selected. In the image above, we’re seeing options for the Canvas itself. By default, you’re viewing the Design tab, but there is also a separate tab for setting up a Prototype —we’ll cover this later in the week.
Now that you’ve found your way around, let’s start making stuff! Let’s start a new project by clicking the Menu button (Figma’s logo) in the top left corner and then selecting File and “New design file.” Doing this should automatically create a new file with an empty canvas in a new tab on your browser.
In Figma, a Frame is essentially a container for other elements. If you’ve used Sketch or Adobe Illustrator before, it functions in the same way as an Artboard. Press [[F]] to select the Frame Tool. Alternatively, you can click the Frame tool icon in the toolbar at the top of the window. Equally, if you’re used to Sketch, you can also hit [[A]] (for “Artboard”).
Note that we’ll often refer to keyboard shortcuts in these tutorials. It’s worth getting in the habit of using these shortcuts because they’ll significantly speed up your workflow further down the line. In the short videos through this course, you’ll see the keystrokes we use on Mac computers.
There are a couple of ways of creating a Frame. We can either click and drag in the canvas area, or we can select a pre-set Frame size from the Properties panel on the right hand side of the window. We chose the iPhone SE template. Try both ways now!
You’ll probably find yourself wanting to zoom in and out quite a bit in Figma, particularly once we start working with multiple Frames. The standard zoom commands are accessed with [[⌘]][[+]] and [[⌘]][[-]]. Try it now!
Those commands will just focus in on the center of your current view. But there are some other handy zoom commands available:
Select the Frame by clicking on its name, then try alternating these commands to switch between the selection and the whole canvas.
Finally, here’s an *extra* handy zoom tip to move between Frames without having to zoom in and out the whole time:
Another useful tool, particularly when you’re zoomed in close or working on a large file, is the Hand tool. Try pressing and holding the [[Spacebar]] on your keyboard and you’ll see a hand icon pop up. Click and drag to move the whole canvas around. If you’re working with a Mac trackpad, you can do the same by dragging on the trackpad with two fingers.
Next, let’s create some text. Press [[T]] to select the Text tool, and click anywhere within your iPhone SE frame to create a Text layer. This is going to be part of a button design, so let’s type “Sign In”. Hit [[Escape]] to exit the Text tool.
Press [[R]] to select the Rectangle tool. Drag a button-shaped rectangle around the text you just created.
Currently, the text is hidden underneath the rectangle. To fix this, we need to use Figma’s “Arrange” commands. Head over to the Layers panel on the left of the window. Select the “Sign In” text layer, then right-click (PC/Mac) or ctrl-click (Mac) to bring up a list of options. Click “Bring to front”, and the text will now be placed on top of the rectangle.
You can also access Arrange tools using keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
PC:
This being a button, we want the text and rectangle shapes to be centered relative to one another. Figma has a set of “Align” commands that allow us to do this. Make sure that the Move tool is selected by pressing [[Escape]], or [[V]], and then drag a “marquee” (a rectangular selection) around the text and the rectangle.
We can access the Align commands in the Properties (the interface area to the right of the window). Click “Align Horizontal Centers” and “Align Vertical Centers” to get the two objects nicely lined up.
Select the rectangle shape you just created. In the Properties panel, there is a setting called “Corner Radius”, which allows us to make the corners of any shape rounded. Here, type in the number of pixels you want each corner to be rounded by.
To max out the corners and create semi-circles at each end of the rectangle, just enter a number larger than half the object height. (We set ours to 32 so that we’re covered in case we want to make the button a bit bigger later on—but try out some different numbers and see what happens!)
The color settings can also be found in the Properties panel. We often want to attract people’s attention with buttons—so select the rectangle, and pick a bright color! We’ve gone with a bright yellow by typing in a hex code (#EEEE33)—but you can also click to open the color palette, and pick a color that way.
With the text layer selected, you can access settings in the Properties panel to change the font, as well as font size, weight, and color. We’ve stuck with Inter, but switched up to bold and uppercase text. We also aligned the text to center. Try exploring the options!
That brings us to the end of Day 1 of Figma 101! We’ve found our way around the interface, tried out a few basic tools, and created a button that we’ll be able to use in our app.
The final thing to do for today is to give our file a name—to do this, just deselect all objects ([[Escape]] will do the trick), and click where it says “Untitled” at the top of the window. Then type something like “Figma 101 App”. That’s it! Figma stores all your files in the cloud.
See you again tomorrow, when we’ll be creating our first app screen.
Create a login screen for your app.

UPDATED Nov. 3, 2024, at 12:07 PM

We adjust polls for house effects, mode, partisanship, voter likelihood and third parties and weight them based on their firm’s 538 pollster rating and how often it polls.
LAST UPDATED Nov. 1
Now that we are in the closing days of the 2024 presidential race, pollsters have started releasing their final readings of the campaign. They have mostly been a mixed bag. On Friday, Marist College released their highly-anticipated final polls across the Midwestern states, finding Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump by 3 points in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and 2 points in Wisconsin. That would be good news for Harris if those were the only polls released this week, but they weren’t: An Echelon Insights survey found Trump up 5 points in the Keystone State, and CNN/SSRS has the former president up by 1 in Georgia. In aggregate, this has been enough to push our model modestly back in Harris’s direction. Currently, our forecast gives Trump a XXX out of 100 chance of winning the election, and gives Harris a XXX out of 100 chance.
Still, the closeness of the race bears repeating what has become something of a mantra here at 538 recently: A close race in the polls does not necessarily mean the outcome will be close. All seven swing states are still within a normal polling error of going to the candidate who is currently “losing”in each. While the polls have identified a close race, our model shows what you should expect if those polls are off.
538’s forecast is based on a combination of polls and campaign “fundamentals,” such as economic conditions, state partisanship and incumbency. It’s not meant to “call” a winner, but rather to give you a sense of how likely each candidate is to win. Check out our methodology to learn exactly how we calculate these probabilities.
—G. Elliott Morris
The forecast updates at least once a day and whenever we get new data. Uncertainty will decrease as we get closer to Election Day.
We forecast the popular vote only for candidates polling at 5 percent or higher nationally, polling at 10 percent or higher in at least one state or who are on the ballot in almost every state. Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s withdrawal, only Harris and Trump meet these criteria, so we are effectively forecasting the two-way popular vote between Democrats and Republicans.
Number of electoral votes and the probability of a Democratic or Republican win in each state. Outlined states are most likely to give the winner their 270th Electoral College vote.
Use the table below to sort states by name, forecasted margin of victory or two different metrics of how much influence they have over the outcome.
A state’s tipping-point chance is the probability it will give the Electoral College winner their 270th electoral vote. The Voter Power Index (VPI) is a relative measure of how likely an individual voter in that state is to determine the outcome of the election.

Our “snake” chart orders the states by forecasted margin of victory. Scroll to the left or right to see uncompetitive states; more contested states are in the middle. Bigger segments mean more Electoral College votes.
This graph shows the national popular vote margin and Electoral College margin in every model simulation. It shows you how often a candidate wins the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.
Our forecast is based on a combination of the polls and various economic and political variables we call the “fundamentals.” This chart shows how we get from the polls today to a forecast for Election Day.
The state of public opinion today, according only to 538’s average of national polls.
The national polling average adjusted for results of state polls and the effects of party conventions.
The adjusted polling average with uncertainty intervals that account for potential movement in the race between now and Election Day. This does not account for the chance that the polls systematically underestimate one candidate.
00
What our fundamentals model alone would predict the popular vote margin to be.
00
Our final forecast of the popular vote, based on a weighted average of the polls and fundamentals using the weights above. This accounts for the chance that the polls systematically underestimate one candidate.
Forecast components may not exactly add up to full forecast because of rounding and random sampling. (When combining the components, we take a random sample of simulations from each, and they may not exactly match the full sample of simulations.)

Paragraphs:

Nate CohnChief political analyst
While the overall result of our final Times/Siena polls is largely unchanged since our previous wave of battleground polls, there were some notable shifts. Surprisingly, the longstanding gap between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt battlegrounds narrowed considerably. The overall effect of these swings is somewhat contradictory — Harris’s position in the Electoral College isn’t necessarily improved. Updated Nov. 3

Both Trump and Harris have states they can probably count on to get at least 200 electoral votes, but they need to get to 270 to win. Let’s zoom in on seven key states in the middle where the vote was closest in 2020.
Harris 251
Trump 268
If the polls miss in Trump’s favor Trump could win if the polls are underestimating him even slightly. In 2016 and 2020, he outperformed the polls in the swing states, and he could do it again. Here’s one possibility.
Harris 226
Trump 312
If the polls miss in Harris’s favor Harris could easily prevail if the polls are underestimating her. For example, state polls underestimated Democrats in the 2022 midterms, and they could also miss in that direction this year. Here’s a possible scenario.
Harris 292
Trump 246
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Across the seven swing states that are likely to decide the outcome of this election, the polls are so remarkably close that neither candidate has a meaningful edge in this final stretch. But if the polls are off even by a small margin, it’s possible either candidate could sweep most or all of these states. You can explore all possible scenarios and see the potential paths to victory here. Updated Oct. 23
States are shown in order of the closest current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
We now have enough polls to generate an average in Iowa, after a new poll from the well-regarded pollster J. Ann Selzer. That poll finds Harris up three percentage points. Our average has Trump ahead by 2 percentage points, which puts it in line with the core battleground states. Updated Nov. 2
It’s normal for polls not to match the final results, sometimes by considerable amounts. The ranges in this chart represent the magnitude of each state’s biggest polling miss in recent elections, shown in relation to the current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
In 2016 and 2020, the polls underestimated Trump. But in 2012 they underestimated the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and in 2022 Democrats outperformed polling averages in several key midterm races. Past polling misses can give a sense of the magnitude by which current averages could be wrong, but they are not a guarantee of which way today’s polls may be off.
Every poll here influences the averages above. Polls from “select pollsters,” which meet certain criteria for reliability, count for more and are shown with a diamond. You can filter by state and toggle to show only select pollsters.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Polls by “select pollsters” are shown with a diamond. These pollsters have backgrounds that tend to mean they are more reliable. Also, polls that were conducted by or for partisan organizations are labeled, as they often release only results that are favorable to their cause.
Arrows to the left indicate polling gains for Harris; to the right, for Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Even as Trump has gained over the last few weeks, the battleground states remain extraordinarily tight. With the race so close, it wouldn’t take much of a polling error to yield a different outcome. The polls are never exactly right; if they err one way or another by a point or two, as usual, then either side could win by a decisive margin. Updated Oct. 31
This chart shows how the polling margin has changed over the course of the campaign, first for the Biden vs. Trump matchup, and now for Harris vs. Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Nationwide, Harris now has her smallest lead in our average since the Democratic convention. Most of the major national polls have showed a shift toward Trump since their prior surveys. The size of his gains shouldn’t be overstated — we’re talking about a point or so — but it has nonetheless been enough to make the race more or less truly tied. Whatever edge Harris might have had has vanished. Updated Oct. 23
About our polling averages
Our averages include polls collected by The New York Times and by FiveThirtyEight. The estimates adjust for a variety of factors, including the recency and sample size of a poll, whether a poll represents likely voters, and whether other polls have shifted since a poll was conducted.
We also evaluate whether each pollster: Has a track record of accuracy in recent electionsIs a member of a professional polling organizationConducts probability-based sampling
These elements factor into how much weight each poll gets in the average. And we consider pollsters that meet at least two of the three criteria to be “select pollsters,” so long as they are conducting polls for nonpartisan sponsors. Read more about our methodology.
The Times conducts its own national and state polls in partnership with Siena College. Those polls are included in the averages. Follow Times/Siena polling here.
Maine and Nebraska award two electoral votes to the statewide winner and a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. (Maine has two congressional districts, and Nebraska has three.) Historical election results for these districts are calculated based on votes cast within the current boundaries of the district.

Paragraphs:
With just two days left until Election Day, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are putting the bows on their presidential campaigns, wrapping up arguments in must-win states before their final test: Tuesday, Nov. 5.
The former president has rallies scheduled in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, while the vice president has planned multiple stops in Michigan.
Keep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage live from the campaign trail.
After attending a Sunday morning church service, Kamala Harris grabbed lunch at a chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
The crowd crammed inside Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles erupted into cheers when Harris entered the restaurant, which is owned by former Detroit Lions cornerback Ron Bartell. The vice president worked the room for several minutes, shaking hands with two women who work at the eatery and posing for photos and selfies with other patrons.
Spotted in the crowd: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.
No word on what the VP picked up for lunch.

Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga will join Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff Monday night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the Democratic nominee makes her closing arguments to voters, according to her campaign.
Winfrey and Gaga’s appearances will wrap up a star-studded lineup of back-to-back Harris-Walz events across all seven battleground states, all featuring a range of celebrity appearances and musical performances.
Harris will hold two in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, starting off in Pittsburgh where D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day are slated to perform and ending in Philadelphia. Winfrey and Gaga will be joined on stage by DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan and Adam Blackstone.
The Pennsylvania rallies are part of a series of get-out-the-vote events simultaneously taking place in other critical swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will appear alongside his wife, Gwen Walz, at an early evening event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and wrap up in Detroit, Michigan, with performances by the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, The War and Treaty.

With just two days until the election, Kamala Harris on Sunday made a pitch to Arab Americans who are on the fence about supporting her over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.
Asked by a reporter in Detroit what her closing argument would be to Arab Americans, Harris repeated what she has said previously about the war in the Gaza Strip. The number of “innocent Palestinians” killed is “unconscionable,” she said.
“We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out, and as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end,” Harris said.
Harris also repeated her call for a two-state solution.
–Michael Collins
The line snaked down the halls Sunday afternoon for the Harris/Walz rally at a hotel in Atlanta, where Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were slated to speak. Some people wore T-shirts that read, “We’re not going back’’ and “Republicans for Harris.” Renee Cobbs, 70, of Powder Springs, Georgia was among the first to get into the ballroom.
“I’m celebrating already,’’ Cobbs said as she pinned a Harris button on her jean jacket. “I’m optimistic not only about Georgia, but also the other battleground states.’’
It was Cobbs’ second Harris/Walz rally. She went to hear the vice president at a recent rally in Decatur, Georgia. By Friday, the last day for early voting, more than 4 million people had voted in Georgia, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.
Cobbs said she worries Trump is too negative and pointed to what she called his ramped up rhetoric, which she said has only gotten worse since Harris took the top of the ticket. “Kamala is one of the best things for the country and the world at this point,’’ said Cobbs.

Kamala Harris has cast her vote for president – by mail.
Harris, who served as a U.S. senator from California before becoming vice president, told reporters traveling with her on Sunday that she has filled out her ballot and that it is in the mail.
“My ballot is on its way to California, and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there,” she said.
Harris declined to say how she voted on a California ballot measure that would increase penalties for some theft- and drug-related crimes.
“I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election, and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she said.
–Michael Collins
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.
The American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevents at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.
When reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has ""received a variety of policy ideas"" but ""is focused on Tuesday’s election.""
But in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said ""Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,"" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.

Donald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he ""shouldn't have left"" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.
As Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd, ""we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” adding ""I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.""
Trump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.
− Marina Pitofsky
As voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.
Lichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Silver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his “gut” tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.
− Karissa Waddick
Visiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.
Vance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.
“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.

Kamala Harris followed her guest appearance on Saturday Night Live by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.
Harris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”
Americans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”
The country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5, “we are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
“Morning is on its way,” she said.
–Michael Collins
It is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.
But you can anticipate delays.
Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.
For example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris 17-point advantage among women.
Stefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”
She also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better of under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, childcare was affordable,” Stefanik said.
It was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.

Talking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.
“I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news,” right?” Trump said to laughs from the crowd.
“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.

The former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.
""The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,"" Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.
Trump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.
""We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,"" Trump said. ""And fake polls.""
– David Jackson
Donald Trump at rally in Lititz, Pa. on Sunday morning repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”
“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.
A judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from being able to get their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.
In Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.

Top Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.
The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.
Trump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa in pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.
It’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning females voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.

Sen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”
Fetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.
“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”
Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have made anti-trans attacks a major part of their closing message to voters in the 2024 election, arguing

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.
A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
In an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.
“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”
The Republican governor remained optimistic of his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: ""It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”
– Kathryn Palmer
Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.
""No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,"" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. ""In fact, it’s not even close!""
Even so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
A loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigns today in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.
–David Jackson
Indiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.
Actor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.
In the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”
Ford concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.
–Michael Collins
Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., appearing Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which he appeared to call Trump's supporters ""garbage.""
The president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.
""As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,"" Warnock said, adding that he believes ""That's what Kamala Harris is doing.""
– Marina Pitofsky
Could red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?
The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.
Yet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.
– Des Moines Register staff
The 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.
It's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.
– Marina Pitofsky
Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broke the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.
Carr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a “clear and blatant effort to evade,” the commissions rule, unless NBC offered Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.
“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.
Carr, who was appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.

Works well. Recommend.
I ended up giving it away to a new up coming Chef in the making. He loves it and is happy using it.
This is a wonderful little food processor for those who are single and do not need to prepare a big meal. My daughter saw it and she said when she needs to make a smaller portion she'll come borrow it.
This is wonderful!! It's great for me, as I only cook for 1, or 2 at the most. Fast, easy, and easy clean up!!
So glad I bought this. Just the right size. Use it more then I thought I would.
Remind me about upcoming Cuisinart shows.

Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Be sure to check the food frequently to prevent overprocessing.
If you overprocess, you are likely to get a watery paste instead of a fine chop.
Use the grind function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts.
Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You may have to operate the Mini-Prep Plus Processor for several seconds with some food to achieve the desired results.
Large enough for most chopping/grinding jobs, small enough to store easily

Paragraphs:
Everything you need to know about yoga, including the best yoga poses for beginners at home.
We've been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.
It's never a bad time to start practicing — and reaping the benefits of! — yoga. This ancient practice offers options for all fitness levels and has become increasingly popular in the U.S., with about one in seven Americans practicing yoga, according to a 2017 national survey. While the complex inversions and more rigorous styles can be intimidating, there are many different types of yoga that can be approachable for anyone, at any age or physical ability.
""Start with a class designed for beginners,"" says Peloton Yoga and Meditation Director Ross Rayburn. He recommends beginners kick things off by practicing just once a week and building a more regular cadence from there.
Whether you plan to join a yoga studio or you want to take a virtual yoga class from home, we've compiled everything beginners need to know about starting a regular yoga practice. Of course, before beginning any new exercise regimen, our health and fitness experts recommend consulting with your healthcare provider.
Yoga is a spiritual and physical practice rooted in Indian philosophy that has existed for thousands of years, according to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. There are several different styles of yoga that range from gentle, meditative experiences to more physically intense formats. The mind-body exercise typically consists of doing sequences of physical poses combined with deep breathing techniques.
""Defining 'yoga' is a bit like trying to define a grand concept like spirituality or culture,"" Rayburn says. ""I’ve always been drawn to a dynamic definition that resonates differently depending on the person, time and place. Any practice, both internal and external, that weaves intention, knowledge and affirmative agency can be yoga.""
From improving strength and flexibility to helping manage stress, the benefits of regularly practicing yoga are vast, but the specific benefits you experience will differ based on the type of yoga you do, according to Rayburn. ""Alignment-based yoga can help with strength, flexibility and functionality, while meditational or devotional types of yoga can yield myriad benefits relating to mental and emotional health,"" he says. Some generally well-established yoga health benefits include:
Improved flexibility and balance
A 2016 study in the International Journal of Yoga found improvements in flexibility and balance among a group of male college athletes that practiced yoga twice a week, for a total of 10 weeks. A systematic review from 2019 supports those findings, confirming significant improvements in yogis' lower body flexibility.
Increased strength and muscle tone
One study that evaluated adults participating in a 12-week Hatha yoga intervention saw significant improvements in both cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength. Another study in sedentary adults found that a Hatha yoga regimen was as good as a stretching-strengthening exercise program in improving strength, flexibility, mobility and more.
Enhanced body awareness
Yoga has been long known to improve body awareness, primarily through its ability to connect breath and movement through the practice. A pilot study in 2022 found that a 12-week yoga course for individuals with multiple sclerosis significantly improved their body awareness.
Stress relief
You may feel the stress relief benefits of yoga after just one session. Older adults who practiced yoga regularly for eight weeks reported feeling less stressed — something a salivary cortisol test supported in a 2016 study. What's more, a 2017 study found that middle-aged women secreted lower amounts of cortisol (the stress hormone) after 90 minutes of yoga, compared to resting.
Weight management
A 2013 study analysis concluded that regular yoga practice can help promote weight loss and maintenance, combined with a healthy diet. Another study from 2018 published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity found that a regular yoga practice supported healthy eating, management of emotional eating and even increased capacity to be active.
Injury prevention
Since yoga can improve flexibility and mobility, it can be a great tool for fixing muscle imbalances and alleviating tightness than can contribute to future injuries.
Help with pain management
Scientists named yoga one of the most effective exercises for alleviating chronic pain in a 2017 study review. In a 2020 review of 25 randomized controlled trials, researchers found that 20 studies supported positive outcomes regarding yoga and back pain relief.
Manage chronic disease symptoms
Regular physical activity in general can help prevent several chronic diseases. When it comes to yoga, thousands of study participants in a year-long relaxation program involving meditation, yoga and prayer visited their doctors 43% less than the year before, according to 2015 research from Massachusetts General Hospital. Another set of studies out of UCLA found just 12 minutes of Kirtan Kriya meditation (which involves chanting and finger poses) every day for eight weeks helped decrease the immune system's inflammatory response, which is promising since inflammation levels are tied to pretty much every major disease.
When it comes to the best poses for beginners looking to start a yoga practice, Rayburn suggests starting with any of these common poses — try flowing through the sequence below to create a complete yoga workout at home.
Pro tip: Take your time and hold each movement for a few breaths before moving on to the next one.
This foundational pose can be relaxing and serve as a great reset during a class. If you ever need a second during your flow to regroup, you can always come back to child's pose.
Downward facing dog may be one of the first poses you'll learn in any yoga class, since it is an important part of many yoga practices. It's one of the main poses during sun salutations and something you can return to throughout class, as well.
Another favorite pose of Rayburn's, this one is great for stretching the lower body and opening up the chest.
This pose, also common in sun salutations, is ideal for improving posture as backbends are great for counteracting prolonged sitting.
This powerful pose is great for strengthening the legs, arms and core.
This empowering pose increases balance and strength. If you can't reach your fingertips all the way to the ground, consider utilizing a yoga block.
Great for opening the hips, this popular yoga pose targets the lower body and can provide a fantastic stretch. Ease into the movement and only fold forward if you feel stable once in position.
Another popular backbend, this pose can help improve posture and also relieve lower back pain.
Not only does this standing yoga pose help improve your balance and coordination, but it also focuses on posture and alignment. Engage your core to help steady yourself.
This grounding pose is all about relaxation and quieting the mind. If you feel any tension under your lower back, consider placing a rolled-up blanket beneath your knees.
Whether you're looking for a rigorous workout or a more meditative experience, there are a variety of yoga styles to meet your needs. Yoga was often referred to as a tree in ancient times, with six branches that include Raja (path of meditative focus), Karma (path of service), Bhakti (path of devotion), Jnana (path of wisdom and knowledge), Tantra (path of rituals) and Hatha (path that focuses on mastery of the body). You may gravitate towards one particular branch, but know that you can explore different paths and may find that many of these branches naturally overlap.
In terms of the types of yoga classes offered, some common ones you may encounter include:
If you're brand new to yoga, Rayburn says that taking a class specifically designed for beginners is ideal so you can learn proper form at the very beginning of your yoga journey. In general, you'll want to take your time with the movements and go slow, as the practice is designed to be mindful and purposeful in movement.
If your first class doesn't go as well as you wanted it to, don't get discouraged. ""Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that 'yoga is not for me' just because your first class is not the best experience,"" he says, adding that it may take a few classes to find an instructor that resonates with you and inspires you to practice regularly. Once you find the right class format and instructor, you'll start to feel more empowered by the yoga experience.
While you may be tempted to go hard in the beginning, it is crucial to listen to your body and know your limits. ""Notice if you’re not able to breathe deeply,"" suggests Rayburn. ""The breath can be a great guide for slowing down, modifying or taking a rest."" Also try to differentiate between feeling discomfort versus feeling acute sensations and pain. You can always return back to downward facing dog or child's pose whenever you need to reset during class.
Most yoga studios provide equipment, but check in advance to see if you'll need to bring anything to class. You may want to take your own mat for hygiene purposes, or if you have a particular preference on style and thickness. Some yoga studios will provide accessories for you, but if you're practicing yoga at home through a yoga app or online class, then you'll want to consider having a few things on hand:
When it comes to clothing, Rayburn says it depends on what makes you feel most comfortable. He generally recommends wearing yoga pants that allow you to move freely. Yoga is typically done barefoot, but if you prefer to wear socks, our experts suggest grip socks.

If you’re a beginner to yoga, it can seem intimidating. Between the gravity-defying poses you see on Instagram and the overwhelming array of class options, it can be easy to think of yoga as exclusive. The truth is, yoga is for everyone and you don’t need gymnast-level flexibility to give it a try. In fact, the reason you do yoga isn’t because you’re flexible—it’s to become more flexible in your body as well as your life.
Here, you’ll find everything you need to know about yoga for beginners: the benefits of a regular practice, beginner poses, how to find the right class for you, practicing at home, and more.
The word “yoga” derives from a Sanskrit word that means “to yoke” or “to unite.” This makes sense when you consider that yoga is a practice meant to unite the mind, body, and spirit.
Much of the yoga practiced in the West today focuses strongly on asana, meaning the physical practice, but the physical postures are just one aspect of yoga. There are ancient philosophical texts that define yoga as a state of mind that has nothing to do with physical postures and movements.
“Yoga” is a very old term that originated in India, explains Indu Arora, an Ayurveda and yoga therapist and author of Yoga: Ancient Heritage, Tomorrow’s Vision. “Its roots are found in ancient texts called Vedas, which are about 3,000- to 5,000-year-old texts,” she says.
As Arora explains, yoga is “that harmonious, peaceful, content, still state of mind. Whenever we have found that, we are in that state of yoga.”
That’s why focusing on your breath—pranayama—is considered an essential component of yoga. “Prana” refers to life force or breath sustaining the body; “ayama” means “to extend” or “to draw out.” The two together mean breath extension or control. Some yoga teachers consider pranayama as the most important part of the practice.
When you begin to practice yoga regularly, you’ll unlock a host of health benefits. Because yoga engages the mind, body, and spirit, these span the physical, mental, and emotional realms.
The moving, stretching, and deep breathing during a yoga practice improves blood flow and both stretches and strengthens muscles.
Yoga shows promise for relieving certain kinds of chronic and acute pain—especially low back pain, according to research.
Factors such as stress and a sedentary lifestyle can trigger chronic inflammation, which in turn can raise your risk for disease. Yoga may be a powerful antidote. Studies have found that practicing yoga may help lower blood levels of an inflammation-promoting immune cell called IL-6 and cortisol, also known as the “stress hormone.”
The evidence is overwhelming: Yoga appears to be an effective way to boost heart health, help manage heart conditions, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Yoga has been found to help decrease depressive symptoms and significantly reduce stress and anxiety. Research continues to find that meditation is effective in relieving symptoms of depression as well.
The practice of holding postures, breathing intentionally, and meditating all train you to fine-tune your attention by syncing your breathing with movement, focusing on the subtleties of your inhalations and exhalations, and letting go of distracting thoughts.
Studies have also shown that a regular yoga practice promotes positive emotions and body image. “Yoga has helped me to deal with life struggles,” says Kiesha Battles, yoga teacher and trainer, and co-director of the Yoga Retreat for Women of Color. “It allows me to have more clarity in the way I see things so that I can deal with troubles or problems.”
When practiced consistently, yoga may help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep, decrease sleep disturbances, and improve sleep quality.
RELATED The Benefits of Yoga: 38 Ways Yoga Can Improve Your Life
If you’ve ever browsed yoga class schedules, you’ve likely encountered a slew of options—including some with names that you don’t understand. These typically signify various types of yoga with approaches that vary in intensity, focus, and styles. Following are some styles of yoga you may encounter:
Here are six basic yoga poses that are beginner-friendly. There are many variations of each yoga pose that can help make them more accessible to your unique body.
Although it may look like a simple standing position, Mountain Pose engages your leg muscles and your core, while establishing greater body awareness and alignment.
How to:
Cat Pose can help relieve tension in your low, middle, and upper back, as well as improve posture. This pose is often paired with Cow Pose (see below) for a gentle flow. How to:
Cow Pose can be done on your hands and knees, or even in a seated position during chair yoga. Cow Pose may help increase mobility, especially for people experiencing muscle and joint stiffness. How to:
Cobra Pose may help improve symptoms of chronic low back pain by increasing flexibility and core strength. Though you may see yogis straightening their arms and more deeply arching their backs, it’s okay to stay low to the ground, especially if you’re new to Cobra Pose.
How to:
Child’s Pose and its variations provide a stretch for the lower back and hips. This pose is often recommended for yogis to return to throughout a class or sequence.
How to:
Yogis rest in Savasana at the end of each practice. This pose offers a chance to find inner stillness after the physical movement of a yoga class.
Savasana may provide deep relaxation, which promotes stress reduction.
How to:
There are many different breathwork, or pranayama, techniques, including simply slowing your breath. Another common and traditional form of breathwork is Ujjayi. This type of breathing pattern is approximately equal length inhalations and exhalations and should feel both energizing and relaxing. It’s created by gently constricting the opening of the throat to create some resistance to the passage of air. An effective Ujjayi breath renders a soothing sound.
At the beginning of class, a yoga teacher may guide students through one or more breathing techniques, including Ujjayi as well as:

It’s normal if you feel awkward when you first start practicing yogic breathwork. Try to be patient with yourself and over time, you may become more comfortable and reap the benefits breathwork can offer.
In a study in the International Journal of Yoga, researchers found that pranayama is linked with stress relief, improved cardiovascular health and respiratory function, and enhanced cognition.
A well-known saying goes something like “Movement with awareness is yoga. Movement without awareness is exercise.” That awareness includes attention to your breath as you move throughout the poses.

In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, a text compiled by an ancient sage named Patanjali, many different concepts of yoga are brought together under one umbrella, Arora explains. The result is structured guidance on how to achieve a yogic state of mind.
As Patanjali explains, yoga encompasses eight limbs (or steps) that essentially serve as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. These limbs are a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline, direct attention toward one’s health, and help us acknowledge the spiritual aspects of our nature as humans.
The eight limbs of yoga are:
You don’t need to know a ton about how to do yoga before you attend your first class. “That’s why you’re there—you’re there to learn,” says Susanna Barkataki, yoga teacher trainer and author of Embrace Yoga’s Roots: Courageous Ways to Deepen Your Yoga Practice.
Start by doing a Google search for “Beginner yoga classes near me.” Some yoga studios have class schedules on their websites while others use apps. Most studios prefer that students reserve classes ahead of time, which you can often do online, in order to ensure classes aren’t overbooked and students aren’t turned away at the door.
Classes that are described as foundational, gentle, or beginner are great options if you’re just starting out. So are restorative or yin yoga classes.
Of course, it may help to email or call your local yoga studio to ask whether a particular class is beginner-friendly. If you have any injuries or health conditions, you may also choose to disclose that to the studio or the teacher, who can advise you on which of their classes would best suit your needs.
If you want to try beginner yoga at home before ever stepping foot into a studio, there are tons of free resources online for yogis. Check out these 10-minute beginner yoga videos:

There is no dress code for most yoga classes. But you’ll want to make sure that the fabric you wear is stretchy enough to accommodate movement. While yoga pants are popular, you can wear gym shorts, sweatpants, a sweat-wicking workout top, a t-shirt, a sports bra—anything you’re most comfortable in.
If it’s your first time going to yoga class at a studio, you most likely don’t need to bring anything (aside from a water bottle to stay hydrated). It’s common practice for people to rent a yoga mat from the studio or bring their own. If you borrow a mat, many studios provide sanitizing wipes so you can clean the mat before and after use.
As you practice more, you’ll learn what you need for a comfortable experience. You may choose to purchase your own yoga mat and even, if you practice at home, other props such as blocks and blankets.
Using props is about making yoga comfortable and accessible for you. Yoga instructors will often show various modifications for a single pose using props that the studio provides.
Common yoga props include:
Keep in mind that yoga is a mind-body-spirit practice that is about much more than just fitness. So if your yoga class incorporates some non-movement elements—such as breathwork, meditation, or intention-setting (sankalpa) at the beginning of class—be open to those aspects of the practice.
In India, where yoga originated, it’s a sign of respect to remove your shoes before you enter someone’s home, temple, or practice space. The same is expected in a yoga class.
While many teachers provide hands-on adjustments for students, know that you have the right to decline. Some teachers may ask students to raise their hands at the beginning of class if they do not wish to be touched throughout a practice. You can also tell your teacher directly before the practice begins. Always speak up if any hands-on adjustments make you feel uncomfortable in any way. “I think that’s another piece of the etiquette going both ways,” says Barkataki.
Many, but certainly not all, yoga teachers call poses by their Sanskrit names, in addition to or instead of their English interpretations. Don’t feel like you need to brush up on this ancient Indian language before taking your first yoga class. However, it’s helpful to understand the meaning of certain well-known Sanskrit words and phrases. If you hear something in class you don’t understand, simply ask the teacher to explain it to you after class.
The following are some common yoga terms:

How to Find a Beginner Yoga Class
Basic Yoga Class Etiquette
Common Yoga Terms
Vinyasa Yoga: Vinyasa classes typically comprise a sequence of poses that are moved through with one movement per breath.
Restorative Yoga: A Restorative yoga class typically involves only five or six relaxing poses—supported by props, such as blankets, bolsters, pillows, blocks, or stacks of books—that you linger in for several minutes. The postures are designed to help you to release tension and rest.
Hot Yoga: Any style of yoga practiced in an intentionally heated room is hot yoga. The temperature is believed to encourage increased flexibility, although it’s important to exert caution.
Yin Yoga: A relatively recently developed style, Yin yoga involves variations of seated and supine stretches that are typically held for 3 to 5 minutes to access fascia, a type of connective tissue that is the subject of much research. Exerting subtle tension on fascia can improve flexibility and minimize recovery time from injuries.
Ashtanga Yoga: An athletic and demanding practice based on several set sequences of postures that remain the same, an Ashtanga yoga practice is taught in increasing levels of difficulty. Beginners start with the Primary Series.
Hatha Yoga: Unlike vinyasa, Hatha yoga focuses on individual poses and not the linking of poses from one to the next. The practice is meant to deepen your understanding of each pose.
Yoga Therapy: Any yogic technique used to systematically address physical injury or pain, as well as mental and emotional stress or trauma, can be considered yoga therapy.
Iyengar Yoga: By paying careful attention to the alignment of each posture, Iyengar yoga is the practice of precision. Poses are held for extended periods of time and students are often supported with props to experience the posture’s intended alignment.
Jivamukti Yoga: This style of yoga is defined by incorporating chanting, meditation, pranayama, philosophy, and music into a vigorous vinyasa practice. Jivamukti is a physically and intellectually stimulating type of yoga.
Kundalini Yoga: A blend of spiritual and physical practices, Kundalini yoga includes less of an emphasis on movement and more on dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and the chanting of mantras.
Power Yoga: This practice flows from one pose to the next. Power yoga has many of the same qualities as Ashtanga and some types of vinyasa, including building internal heat, increasing stamina, enhancing strength and flexibility, as well as reducing stress.
Prenatal Yoga: With an emphasis on breathing, stamina, pelvic floor work, restorative poses, and core strength, prenatal yoga can be practiced both during and after pregnancy.
Tantra Yoga: By harnessing and embodying the five forces of Shakti, the divine feminine that represents creativity and change, tantric yoga intends to help you move through the world with more confidence and contentment.
Stand with your big toes touching, heels slightly apart.
Reach your tailbone toward the floor.
Broaden your collarbones and let your arms hang at your sides, palms facing forward.
Hold Mountain Pose for up to 10 breaths.
Start on your hands and knees with your knees directly below your hips and your wrists, elbows, and shoulders in line.
As you exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling and release your head toward the floor without forcing your chin to your chest.
Repeat Cat Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Start on your hands and knees. Make sure your knees are directly below your hips and your wrists; elbows and shoulders are in line.
As you inhale, lift your sitting bones and chest toward the ceiling, allowing your belly to sink toward the floor. Lift your head to look straight forward.
Exhale, coming back to your hands and knees.
Repeat Cow Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Lie on your stomach with your palms on the floor, fingertips in line with the middle of your chest. Place a folded towel or blanket underneath your hip bones for added cushioning. Extend your legs.
Slowly press your palms into the floor and draw your shoulder blades together. Keep your shoulders down.
Keep a deep bend in both arms as you expand your chest forward.
Hold for 5 to 10 breaths and slowly lower yourself back down to the floor.
Begin in a seated position with your bottom on top of your feet, placing a rolled blanket or towel in between if it’s more comfortable.
Touch your big toes together and widen your knees out to the side as you slowly walk your hands out in front of you.
Bring your forehead to the floor. If it’s more accessible, place a book, block, or blanket beneath your forehead.
Stay in this position anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. To come out of Child’s Pose, slowly walk your hands back toward your body and rise up to seated.
Lie down slowly onto your back and soften (but don’t flatten) your lower back onto the floor. If it’s more comfortable, support the back of your head and neck on a folded blanket or towel.
Release your arms to the floor. Rest the backs of your hands on the floor. Make sure your shoulder blades are resting evenly on the floor.
Soften your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. Relax your face.
Try to stay in this pose for at least 5 minutes at the end of your practice. To exit, first roll gently with an exhalation onto one side. Take 2 or 3 breaths. With another exhalation press your hands against the floor and lift your torso, dragging your head slowly after. Your head should always come up last.
Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)
Cooling Breath (Shitali Pranayama)
Breath of Fire (Kapalabhati Pranayama)
Yama (ethical standards toward others)
Niyama (self-discipline and inner observances)
Asana (physical postures, which many Westerners think of as yoga)
Pranayama (breath control)
Pratyahara (sensory transcendence)
Dharana (concentration)
Dhyana (meditation)
Samadhi (self-realization)
Yoga mats: You may be surprised to learn that yoga mats are not a must, says Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga. “You really don’t have to use a yoga mat unless you really want that stickiness, that extra traction,” he explains. In lieu of a mat, you could practice on wood floors, with a towel, or on carpeting, especially if you’re practicing at home.
Yoga Blanket: This item is a staple in restorative yoga and can also be used to support your knees, wrists, and back throughout any practice. Look for a blanket that is thick in texture to ensure you have adequate support, Battles advises.
Yoga Blocks: Blocks are another common prop that effectively brings the floor to you in various poses and adds stability and balance to your practice. Blocks are often used by beginner and experienced yogis alike to help them work within the limitations of their bodies and allow them to find alignment with less strain.
Yoga Straps: Straps, explains Battles, extend your reach in postures. If you have a stiff lower back or tight hamstrings, for example, the strap allows you to find alignment in more poses. You can buy a yoga strap or instead use a long, flexible item like a towel, belt, sweatshirt, or tie.
Asana: Refers to the physical practice of yoga or poses
Chakra: Relates to the seven energetic parts of the body that we can’t see or touch but that connect us to universal energy
Mantra: A word or phrase that is repeated during yoga practice and meditation
Namaste: A sign of respect often said between yoga teachers and their students at the end of class

Reddit's best place for all things yoga.
If you want to learn how to do yoga, you’re in the right place! It will transform your life, but I’ll be the first to admit it can be intimidating to start. What are the poses? What do I wear? Where do I go? It’s a bit overwhelming, but it doesn’t need to be.
Here are a couple resources for you to check out when you have some time:
https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene Disclaimer: I've never actually taken her classes, but the online world raves about her videos. She offers a large variety, so this could be a great place to start. And they are free (yay!)
Just by the titles, these are the ones I would start with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYKMP6rOE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiKJRoX_2uo
Adriene also had a 30 day yoga series that could be worth trying too.
I've done a different 30 day challenge from another girl (Erin Motz - The Bad Yogi) and it was a great way to become familiar with the poses and practice regularly. BONUS: the videos are pretty short so it's easy to fit into your schedule and they are free. Here is the link to day one of her 30 day series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbrutThDk7o
This is my FAVORITE yogi of all time - Rachel Brathen. She is @yoga_girl on insta and I went to her yoga retreat a few years ago and it was amazing. UGH I want to go back! https://oneoeight.com/?gclid=CMX6odvfiNECFdU8gQodmQoMrg I pay $14/month for these classes but they have a 10 day free trial you could check out. They have a huge variety of teachers on there, but I've only taken Rachel's classes and they are so good! and kick my ass. I believe they also have meditation on here (I've never tried it) but that could be cool too.
Anyways - this should be good to at least get you started at home. If you find you're interested it would be worth going to a studio (or two) and see which ones you like. I recommend two things: Try to find a groupon. You can get amazing deals this way! See what new student discounts the studio offers. Many of them have a special deal for students who have never been there before Okay, I just thought of a third point… search for local community (or donation based) yoga classes. I usually donate $5-10 per class.
There you have it! My favorite resources to kick start your yoga practice. Of course - if you have any questions you can ask me. I am here to help :)

Paragraphs:
When you’re brand new to yoga, it can feel intimidating and be difficult to know exactly where and how to get started. Our Yoga for Beginners guide was created specifically for you—to give you all the tips, guidelines, and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. To ensure your success, we highly recommend you read this entire page before attempting any yoga.
Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body, and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment.
Hatha Yoga attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), and shatkarma (internal cleansing). These physical practices are used to purify the body and cultivate prana (life-force energy). Modern Hatha Yoga does not emphasize many of these esoteric practices and instead focuses more on the physical yoga postures.
Regardless of what your goals or intentions are for starting, just the yoga poses themselves is a fantastic form of mental and physical exercise.
Yoga is in no way exclusive—being able to practice yoga does not matter how old you are, how much you weigh, what you do for a living, where you live, or what religion you practice. Yoga is accessible for just about everyone.
If you have a medical condition or a recent injury, it can be challenging or dangerous to do certain types of yoga, specific poses, or breathing techniques. Usually, there are alternatives or modifications that can allow you to practice safely, and many common complaints have specific yoga therapy remedies. If you are recovering from an injury or are in poor health, we recommended consulting with a physician or other qualified health care professional before beginning yoga.
While you may feel some intensity in the belly of your muscles while in a yoga pose, you should never feel pain, especially in the joints. A sharp or intense pain is your body’s signal to tell you to stop, back off, and take it easy.
If you are out of shape or extremely inflexible, we recommend you begin with a gentle practice until you have built up the strength and flexibility for more challenging sequences. If you are a relatively fit and flexible person, you should be able to jump right into a regular hatha yoga class. Once you are familiar with the basic postures, you can explore a vinyasa or flow class. We recommend you avoid Ashtanga, Bikram, or hot yoga until you have built up some physical strength and endurance. It is always best to error on the side of caution and safety and approach yoga slowly and carefully. The best way to know if yoga is for you is to give it a try!
Yoga is typically performed in bare feet on a sticky yoga mat with optional yoga props. The yoga movements and poses require clothes that can stretch and move freely with your body. You can purchase clothing specifically designed for yoga practice, but you can probably put together a comfortable outfit from your existing wardrobe to get started.
Yoga classes may use additional props, the most common being straps, blocks, blankets, and bolsters. You don’t need to purchase these right away as you can easily substitute these items with scarves or neckties, a stack of books, and pillows. If you take classes at a yoga studio, they will provide everything that you need.
We recommend that you start with a short and straightforward yoga session and slowly build up from there. Once you feel comfortable with a few basic beginner yoga postures, you can incorporate them into a sequence and continue to add more challenging poses. Make sure you learn and follow the essential components of a yoga practice: breathing, meditation, intention, asanas, and relaxation.

If you can practice yoga 3 or more times per week, you will see significant improvements in your flexibility, range of motion, strength, balance, inner peace, and overall well being. Ideally, we recommend shorter and more frequent sessions, 20-45 minutes long, and for a total of 3-4 hours spread over several days. Practicing yoga less than this amount will still be beneficial, but you will see smaller improvements over a longer period of time. Like most things, the more time you can dedicate towards it, the more benefits you will receive.

The benefits of yoga are almost endless! Practicing yoga helps build healthy virtues and good values, such as discipline, honesty, devotion, self-inquiry, mindfulness, and non-attachment. Yoga empowers you to make conscious choices toward living a more healthy and fulfilling life. Yoga also helps you:
Patience, commitment, repetition, and consistency are the keys to developing and progressing in the practice of yoga. After you’ve found a style, teacher, and yoga studio that works for you, try these tips:

Practice Yoga for BeginnersOur Yoga for Beginners guide will give you the basic tips, guidelines and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. Meditation BasicsMeditation is a focusing of the mind on a single object, creating the cessation of all thought. As thoughts dissipate, the mind becomes quiet, and we are able to be fully in the present moment. The techniques of meditation are simple and easy to learn, but the ability to keep the mind focused takes time, patience and practice. The benefits of a regular meditation practice include reduction of stress, tension, anxiety and frustration, as well as improved memory, concentration, inner peace and whole body well-being. PranayamaPranayama are breathing exercises developed by the ancient yogis for purification. Prana translates into “life force energy” and Yama translates into “control or mastery of”. Thus, Pranyama is used to control, cultivate, and modify the Prana in the body. Prana is taken in through the air we breathe, and since the pranayama exercises increase the amount of air we take in, they also increase our intake of Prana. For all pranayama (except Kapalabhati), the breath is slow and steady, breathed in and out of the nose and down into the belly. Always sit with a straight spine and a relaxed body. While you are practicing pranayama, let go of any thoughts by focusing on the breathing involved with the pranayama. Yoga Postures Seated Yoga Poses Standing Yoga Poses Prone Yoga Poses Supine Yoga Poses Yoga Posture Sequences Warm-up SequencesUse these sequences of simple stretches to warm up prior to any of the pose sequences. Basic SequencesWhere to start if you are new or a beginner. These posture flows are simple, short and only contain basic postures. Beginning SequencesWhere to start if you have some previous experience with yoga. Build on the basic pose sequences by adding more length and challenge to the flow. For more beginning level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Sun SalutationsOften considered the core of hatha yoga practice, Sun Salutations are traditionally practiced at sunrise to warm and energize the body. We have several Sun Salutation sequences available with varying levels of difficulty, from basic to intermediate. Intermediate SequencesBy adding challenging postures to the beginning sequences, these posture flows are the most complex, vigorous and long. For more intermediate level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Special SequencesLooking for something different? These sequences are designed for specific applications, using combinations of yoga postures for their effects on the physical, mental, emotional and energetic bodies.

Learn Yoga 101: The BasicsYoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques, but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment. Though yoga’s ultimate aim is lofty, its essence is practical and scientific as it emphasizes direct experience and observable results. It is not a religion, but a practice of personal inquiry and exploration. As the cultural and religious diversity of practitioners attest, yogic philosophy speaks to universal truths that can be incorporated within any belief system. Philosophy of YogaThe main philosophy of yoga is simple: mind, body and spirit are all one and cannot be clearly separated. Yet there is a multitude of philosophical ideas developed by looking into the deeper dimensions of the body, mind and spirit. Energy AnatomyThe foundation of all life, of the whole universe, is the subtle life force energy the yogis call ‘prana.’ This mystical energy flows through our bodies and generates our every action – from gross physical movements to minute biochemical processes.Hatha and Tantra yogas have developed a rich description of the anatomy of the subtle or energy body, including the different types of energies, the nadi energy channels and chakra energy centers. These yogas have also developed various methods to increase, cultivate and direct this spiritual energy. Articles on Hatha Yoga Yoga TherapyYoga Therapy is the use of yoga postures, meditation and pranayama to help the body naturally heal and balance itself. Certain yogic practices have been shown to have specific healing qualities in addition to yoga’s inherent ability to create wellness and good health. These pages are not intended to treat or diagnose any medical conditions. A yoga practice should be used to supplement conventional therapy. Please consult with a health care professional before starting a yoga program, as some yogic techniques can be harmful if practiced with certain conditions. Please see our site’s terms and conditions for our complete disclaimer. The postures listed under each condition are for general use and will be most effective if professionally modified for personal use by a yoga therapist. Not all of the postures listed are required for practice, use only what feels right for your physical condition and ability. These pages are only a starting point to help your body heal. Experiment and pay attention to what practices make you feel better and improve your condition. Practice slowly and gently as over exertion could cause your condition to worsen. Yoga Therapy Guides:

Tell us about your smile and whitening history over a short quiz.
We’ll create the perfect formula based on your responses.
Use daily for 6 days and say “hello” to your new pearly whites!


""I had to come here to say something. Normally I have excruciating pain with crest white strips and this other brand I got from the dentist. Both of which didn’t whiten my teeth very much. So, I had low hopes for laughland. I got the formula made for highest sensitivity, and I left it on for I think 12 minutes. Just after the first day my teeth look 2 shades whiter. I’m actually really shocked.""
""My teeth had gotten so yellow that I didn't like smiling - especially when I wore lipstick, it made the teeth look more icky. 6 treatments later, it's gotten SO much whiter and I'm wearing lipstick again :)""
""I thought hey worth a shot not really expecting anything great. Wow was I wrong! This has absolutely worked wonders on my teeth! Refill kit has been ordered! I’m obsessed!""
""I. Hate. Whitening. Kits. Except this one. It's easy to use, doesn't create a huge mess, is comfortable (even for small-mouthed folks like me!), and doesn't make your teeth feel slimy and taste weird. Plus, it's SO EFFECTIVE. Worth every penny.""
""This is my best purchase ever. This item OVER-Delivers. My teeth are sparkling and I had ZERO pain. Great Job Laughland.""
""LOVE THIS! My coworkers have been throwing compliments left and right about how my teeth have been shining. THANK YOU!""
Laughland is the only whitening brand to create custom whitening formulas based on your quiz profile. Just as a dentist would prescribe a specific whitening treatment for you, we can optimize the strength of the whitening serum to your unique sensitivity levels, dental history and diet. Hence, our formulas are 3x more effective and clinically tested to show a 74% improvement in whiteness. It's the closest you'll get to a dentist, without having to go to one!
While you'll begin to see differences after your first 10+ minute treatment, but the most noticeable changes will come after 6 days of consecutive whitening treatments. You'll be pleasantly surprised :)
Each kit contains 3 syringes that last for 6 treatments. Results can be immediately noticeable, and lasts months depending on your diet and brushing habits. We recommend users to re-whiten every 2-3 months or as-needed to maintain a shine all year round.
Veneers, caps, implants, bonding or bridges aren’t designed to be whitened, however Laughland can whiten the surrounding teeth to maintain the same shade as your dental work.
We offer a flexible subscription to save you the trouble of re-ordering manually.
You can manage your subscription via your account or by emailing us at team@mylaughland.com anytime.
Our NanoLight technology LED light helps with teeth whitening by activating the ingredients in the whitening gel used during the treatment. Your custom gel contains a variety of bleaching agents that breaks down the stains on the surface of the teeth. When the light is shone on the teeth, it activates the whitening gel, speeding up the chemical reaction and helping the bleaching agent penetrate deeper into the enamel. This results in a more effective and efficient teeth whitening treatment, giving you a brighter and more confident smile. It is important to note that the LED light alone will not change the color of your teeth, but rather enhances the effectiveness of the whitening gel.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
The Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a compact, fast and useful laptop that offers great performance for everyday tasks for everyone in the family due to its portability, let me further explain. The Chromebook 311 has a nice 11.6 inch screen, and it is perfect for movability. It is also lightweight just less than 3 lbs. so it is easy to carry around, either at home, class or maybe at a favorite spot. I like how it feels, it feels sturdy and durable all around and it can withstand minor bumps and drops. It is powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and it has 4GB of RAM, so it easily handles everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, and streaming best of all it does it well. It works great wirelessly, using Wi-Fi connection all around the house it has worked flawlessly. It does have an HD Webcam with dual built in speakers so our kids can take an online class or just to communicate with others, and it does come with a webcam cover for privacy. Another thing we like about the Chromebook is its good battery life. It can last up to 8 hours on a single charge and that is plenty for most people including our kids at home as well as us adults. Since the Chromebook runs on Chrome OS, it is like having my Android cell phone with a bigger screen, keyboard and touchpad which they are responsive and comfortable to use by the way. The system is easy to use and I can access my Google Drive, Google Docs as well as other applications from the Google App store. Overall, the Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a great choice for family like ours, that we can share it since it is very portable and reliable for everyday use. Now that the kids have recently returned to school, they are ready to use the Chromebook too.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
I am quite pleased with the newest Acer 311. The build quality is decent despite being all plastic. That makes it lighter and more portable. The screen can lay 180° flat, stays up, and does not wobble. The keys have very good travel and feel very tactile. The trackpad is plastic but has a nice feel and is clicky. The bezels are bigger than I’d prefer, making the 11.6” display seem smaller. The HD (1366 x 768) screen has acceptable brightness but is a bit washed out and has pretty bad viewing angles. Nevertheless, I can see all text, graphics, and vide clearly. Sadly, there is no touchscreen support. The sound is what you’d expect from a small laptop. OK volume, clear, but no bass whatsoever. About connectivity, we have a USB-C 3.2 and a USB-A 3.1 port. The USB-C doubles as a power delivery and display port. The laptop is Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth compatible and works well and fast. There’s also a 3.8mm audio headphone jack. The N4500 CPU, Intel UHD Graphics, 4GB LPDDR4X memory combined make for a very smooth Chromebook workflow. I had several internet tabs open, (within reason), watched video, did productivity work, played super-basic games, and yes, streamed games with relatively no issues or slowdown. I did notice the laptop got bit warm but nothing uncomfortable and the fans were not loud at all. The 64GB storage is low but considering that this is designed to be used with cloud support, makes it sufficient. The battery life ranges between 8-10 hours depending on the use -good enough for a full workday. The 720P webcam is nothing to write home about but good enough for those basic video calls. I appreciate the included security cam cover. In the end, I think this Chromebook is quite portable and capable of handling everyday tasks. It’s perfect for student use and for anyone that is looking for simplicity and security. While the price could have been a bit lower, this is a great budget option.

This is a basic Chromebook, without any frills. But if your needs are limited, it does get the job done. == Build Quality == The packaging is minimal and without frills, but that is OK as I would rather the money go towards the computer than something that will be thrown away. Once you open up the machine itself, it seems to be decently built. It is all plastic construction, but you expect that for this price. The bottom features no air vents at all, and this machine has no moving parts; not even a single fan. But given the limited power, this is perfectly acceptable, and means that there is less to break in the future. == Peripherals == Being a budget device, the name of the game is giving you basic functionality for as little money as possible, and this has been done well. Obviously some corners were cut, but nothing was cut back in such a way that caused any problems. Everything here falls squarely in the “usable but not impressive” category. The keyboard is acceptable. It works and feels good, but it is not backlit at all. The trackpad is also well done, despite having a plastic surface. Multi-touch gestures also work well, but it is not especially smooth or gigantic. But it is adequate, and that is enough for this type of machine. There is a camera above the display that is more than good enough for Zoom or Teams meetings, and although it lacks a privacy shutter, Acer thought to include a slim self-adhesive shutter in the package that you can apply if you desire. The display itself is perhaps a little disappointing, being only 1366 by 768, and the contrast and brightness are nothing special. Of note is that the color seems to shift a little bit as you move your head from side to side, but once again, higher quality brings higher prices, and this display is certainly usable. But the largest surprise is that the speakers are surprisingly good given the size and price. There is actually more bass and volume than I expected. As to the included IO, other than the expected BlueTooth and WiFi, it features a single USB-A rated for up to 5Mbps, one 3.5mm audio jack, and a single USB-C port that is used for charging, adding external devices, and can do video out. This computer had no problems driving an external 3440 by 1440 display, if that is the sort of thing that you need. A USB-C power supply is included, but this can use any USB-C charger large enough to drive a laptop. Note that there is nothing inside that is upgradable. Everything is soldered down to the main board. == Performance == They say that it is what is inside that counts, and this does not have much inside, but for many it will be enough. This Chromebook uses a dual-core x86 processor backed up by 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of flash storage. Note that there is no way to expand anything; neither RAM nor SSD. The performance is perfectly OK for light office tasks. Google Docs and Google Sheets both work well, as do the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Sometimes the Firefox browser seemed a little sluggish when starting up or trying to type in a new URL, but they got the job done, even though I had to wait a second or two longer than I was accustomed to. Also inside is a 33 WH battery, which gives around seven hours of life away from a charger with light usage. == Software == The thing about a Chromebook is that it is a Chromebook. You are limited in the apps that you can run. But with that being understood, it can run most Android apps. I had no problems installing Google Docs and Sheets, and Microsoft Teams installed easily, as well as BitWarden password manager. The only issues that I encountered were that I could not install Microsoft Outlook, and the Amazon shopping app (but Amazon Prime Video was not a problem). There is also an option to get a Linux terminal window up, but I am not sure how useful that will be to most people in the market for this type of computer. == Summary == This is a machine with several compromises, but it is built to hit an affordable price point. If you need a Chromebook, and this is a machine that you can afford, then it is worthy of consideration. All of the compromises are acceptable, and none of them are deal-breakers.

Paragraphs:
The British government has banned the phrase fake news from appearing in official papers or documents after ruling the term is ""poorly defined and misleading.""
Instead, ministers will have to use the words disinformation when referring to the act of purposely spreading false information and misinformation when it occurs inadvertently.
The suggestion to ban the phrase often used by President Donald Trump during his attacks on the media was made in a report by the U.K. Parliament's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee, as the term fake news is ""bandied around with no clear idea of what it means.""
""The term has taken on a variety of meanings, including a description of any statement that is not liked or agreed with by the reader,"" the recommendation said.
The British government responded: ""We agree that 'fake news' is a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.
""Over the past several months during its work on this issue the Government has sought to move away from 'fake news' and instead has sought to address 'disinformation' and wider online manipulation.
""In our work we have defined disinformation as the deliberate creation and sharing of false and/or manipulated information that is intended to deceive and mislead audiences, either for the purposes of causing harm, or for political, personal or financial gain. 'Misinformation' refers to the inadvertent sharing of false information.""
However, British politicians will still be allowed to use the phrase if they wish while speaking in the House of Commons, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Avoiding the phrase was one of 42 recommendations made in the committee's report, titled ""Disinformation and 'Fake News.'"" The interim report, published in July, warned that ""democracy is at risk"" if more isn't done to combat alleged foreign interference in elections or the use of manipulation of personal data to spread disinformation.
The interim report was set up in the wake of continuing concerns over Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
Only three of the report's 42 recommendations were accepted outright by the British government, with four recommendations rejected, the committee confirmed in a statement.
Damian Collins, the committee's chair and a Conservative member of Parliament for Folkestone and Hythe, said he is ""disappointed"" by the government's response to the report.
""We need to see a more coordinated approach across government to combat campaigns of disinformation being organized by Russian agencies seeking to disrupt and undermine our democracy,"" Collins said. ""The government's response gives us no real indication of what action is being taken on this important issue.""

Paragraphs:
Deepfake videos are a portmanteau word - 'deep' from 'deep learning' and 'fake', obviously, from 'fake'. Deep learning is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) method which uses multiple layers of machine learning algorithms to extract progressively higher-level features from raw input. It's capable of learning from unstructured data - such as the human face. For instance, an AI can gather data on your physical movements.
That data can then be processed in order to create a Deepfake video through a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). This is another kind of specialized machine learning system. Two neural networks are used to compete with each other in learning the characteristics of a training set (for instance, photographs of faces) and then generating new data with the same characteristics (new 'photographs').
Because such a network keeps testing the images it creates against the training set, the fake images become increasingly convincing. This makes Deepfake an ever more potent threat. Plus, GANs can fake other data besides photos and video. In fact, the same Deepfake machine learning and synthesizing techniques can be used to fake voices.

High profile Deepfake examples are not hard to find. One example of a Deepfake is the video issued by actor Jordan Peele in which he used real footage of Barack Obama merged with his own impression of Obama to issue a warning against Deepfake videos. He then showed how the two halves of the merged video looked when separated. His advice? We need to question what we see.
A video of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appearing to talk about how Facebook ’controls the future’ via stolen user data - notably on Instagram. The original video comes from a speech he gave on Russian election interference - just 21 seconds of that speech were enough to synthesize the new video. However, the voice impersonation wasn't as good as Jordan Peele's Obama and gave the truth away.
But even less well-made fakes can have a remarkable impact. A video of Nancy Pelosi 'drunk' scored millions of views on YouTube – but it was simply a fake made by slowing down a video artificially to give the effect of her slurring her words. And many celebrity women have found themselves 'starring' in revenge porn made by morphing their faces into porn films and images.
Deepfake videos have been used for political purposes, as well as for personal revenge. But increasingly they're being used in major attempts at blackmail and fraud.
The CEO of a British energy firm was tricked out of $243,000 by a voice Deepfake of the head of his parent company requesting an emergency transfer of funds. The fake was so convincing that he didn't think to check; the funds were wired not to the head office, but to a third party's bank account. The CEO only became suspicious when his 'boss' requested another transfer. This time, alarm bells rang - but it was too late to get back the funds he'd already transferred.
In France, a recent fraud didn't use Deepfake tech, but used impersonation, together with meticulous copying of Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian's office and its furnishings, to defraud senior executives of millions of euros. Fraudster Gilbert Chikli is alleged to have disguised himself as the minister to ask wealthy individuals and company executives for ransom money to liberate French hostages in Syria; he's currently standing trial.

It's also possible that Deepfake authors could blackmail company presidents by threatening to publish a damaging Deepfake video unless they're paid off. Or intruders could get into your network simply by synthesizing a video call from your Chief Information Officer, tricking employees into giving up passwords and privileges, which then lets hackers run riot all over your sensitive databases.
Deepfake porn videos have already been used to blackmail female reporters and journalists, such as Rana Ayyub in India, who exposes abuses of power. As the technology becomes cheaper, expect to see more uses of Deepfake to blackmail and defraud.
Legislation is already beginning to address the threats of Deepfake videos. For instance, in the state of California, two bills passed last year made aspects of Deepfake illegal - AB-602 banned the use of human image synthesis to make pornography without the consent of the people depicted and AB-730 banned manipulation of images of political candidates within 60 days of an election.
But is this going far enough? Fortunately, cyber-security companies are coming up with more and better detection algorithms all the time. These analyze the video image and spot the tiny distortions which are created in the ‘faking’ process. For instance, current Deepfake synthesizers model a 2D face, and then distort it to fit the 3D perspective of the video; looking at which way the nose is pointing is a key giveaway.
Deepfake videos are still at a stage where you can spot the signs yourself. Look for the following characteristics of a Deepfake video:
But as Deepfakes get better, you'll get less help from your own eyes and more from a good cyber-security program.
Some emerging technologies are now helping video makers authenticate their videos. A cryptographic algorithm can be used to insert hashes at set intervals during the video; if the video is altered, the hashes will change. AI and blockchain can register a tamper-proof digital fingerprint for videos. It's similar to watermarking documents; the difficulty with video is that the hashes need to survive if the video is compressed for use with different codecs.
Another way to repel Deepfake attempts is to use a program that inserts specially designed digital ‘artifacts’ into videos to conceal the patterns of pixels that face detection software uses. These then slow down Deepfake algorithms and lead to poor quality results — making the chances of successful Deepfaking less likely.
But technology isn't the only way to protect against Deepfake videos. Good basic security procedures are remarkably efficient at countering Deepfake.
For instance, having automatic checks built into any process for disbursing funds would have stopped many Deepfake and similar frauds. You can also:
Remember that if Deepfake starts to be deployed by hackers in their attempts to break into home and business networks, then basic cyber-security best practice will play a vital role when it comes to minimizing the risk:
Deepfake keeps evolving. Two years ago, it was really easy to tell Deepfake videos by the clunky quality of the movement and the fact that the faked person never seemed to blink. But the latest generation of fake videos has evolved and adapted.
There are estimated to be over 15,000 Deepfake videos out there right now. Some are just for fun, while others are trying to manipulate your opinions. But now that it only takes a day or two to make a new Deepfake, that number could rise very rapidly.

h1: Coronavirus: Scientists brand 5G claims 'complete rubbish'
h2: Conspiracy theory
h2: Top stories
h2: More to explore
h2: Elsewhere on the BBC

Paragraphs:
Conspiracy theories claiming 5G technology helps transmit coronavirus have been condemned by the scientific community.
Videos have been shared on social media showing mobile phone masts on fire in Birmingham and Merseyside - along with the claims.
The UK's mobile networks have reported 20 cases of masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital.
The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.
TV regulator Ofcom is assessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmes in which he cast doubts on media outlets for their attempts to debunk the claims.
But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible.
The conspiracy theories have been branded ""the worst kind of fake news"" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis.
Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus.
These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US.
They appear to fall broadly in to two camps:
One claims 5G can suppress the immune system, thus making people more susceptible to catching the virus.
The other suggests the virus can somehow be transmitted through the use of 5G technology.
Both these notions are ""complete rubbish,"" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading.
Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside, prompting investigations
""The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,"" Dr Clarke says.
""Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.""
While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect.
""Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.""
The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.
It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds.
""The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,"" he says.
It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology.
There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece: Does 5G pose health risks?
Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, saying there was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses.
But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated.
Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were ""concerning,"" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is ""absolutely no credible evidence for the link"".
Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes.
Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

h1: How Teens In The Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News

Paragraphs:
BuzzFeed News identified more than 100 pro-Trump websites being run from a single town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
BuzzFeed Founding Editor, Canada
BuzzFeed Contributor
""This is the news of the millennium!"" said the story on WorldPoliticus.com. Citing unnamed FBI sources, it claimed Hillary Clinton will be indicted in 2017 for crimes related to her email scandal.
""Your Prayers Have Been Answered,"" declared the headline.
For Trump supporters, that certainly seemed to be the case. They helped the baseless story generate over 140,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.
Meanwhile, roughly 6,000 miles away in a small town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a young man watched as money began trickling into his Google AdSense account.
Over the past year, the Macedonian town of Veles (population 45,000) has experienced a digital gold rush as locals launched at least 140 US politics websites. These sites have American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, and USADailyPolitics.com. They almost all publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the US.
The young Macedonians who run these sites say they don't care about Donald Trump. They are responding to straightforward economic incentives: As Facebook regularly reveals in earnings reports, a US Facebook user is worth about four times a user outside the US. The fraction-of-a-penny-per-click of US display advertising — a declining market for American publishers — goes a long way in Veles. Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook — and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters.
As a result, this strange hub of pro-Trump sites in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is now playing a significant role in propagating the kind of false and misleading content that was identified in a recent BuzzFeed News analysis of hyperpartisan Facebook pages. These sites open a window into the economic incentives behind producing misinformation specifically for the wealthiest advertising markets and specifically for Facebook, the world's largest social network, as well as within online advertising networks such as Google AdSense.
""Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that 'if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,'"" said a university student in Veles who started a US politics site, and who agreed to speak on the condition that BuzzFeed News not use his name.
Sample stories from US politics sites run by Macedonians.
Using domain name registration records and online searches, BuzzFeed News identified over 100 active US politics websites being run from Veles. The largest of these sites have Facebook pages that boast hundreds of thousands of followers.
BuzzFeed News also identified another 40 US politics domains registered by people in Veles that are no longer active. (An April report from the Macedonian website Meta.mk identified six pro-Trump sites being run from Veles. A Guardian report identified 150 politics sites.)
Their reasons for launching these sites are purely financial, according to the Macedonians with whom BuzzFeed News spoke.
""I started the site for a easy way to make money,"" said a 17-year-old who runs a site with four other people. ""In Macedonia the economy is very weak and teenagers are not allowed to work, so we need to find creative ways to make some money. I'm a musician but I can't afford music gear. Here in Macedonia the revenue from a small site is enough to afford many things.""
Most of the posts on these sites are aggregated, or completely plagiarized, from fringe and right-wing sites in the US. The Macedonians see a story elsewhere, write a sensationalized headline, and quickly post it to their site. Then they share it on Facebook to try and generate traffic. The more people who click through from Facebook, the more money they earn from ads on their website.
Earlier in the year, some in Veles experimented with left-leaning or pro–Bernie Sanders content, but nothing performed as well on Facebook as Trump content.
""People in America prefer to read news about Trump,"" said a Macedonian 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com.
BuzzFeed News' research also found that the most successful stories from these sites were nearly all false or misleading.
For example, the most successful post BuzzFeed News found from a Macedonian site is based on a story from a fake news website. The headline on the story from ConservativeState.com was ""Hillary Clinton In 2013: 'I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They’re Honest And Can’t Be Bought.'"" The post is a week old and has racked up an astounding 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. (To put that into perspective, the New York Times' exclusive story that revealed Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns generated a little more than 175,000 Facebook interactions in a month.)
The viral Clinton story was sourced from TheRightists.com, a site that admits it publishes both real and fake content. According to emails released by WikiLeaks, Clinton said in a private speech to Goldman Sachs that she would like to see more successful business people enter politics. But she did not mention Donald Trump in any way. The quote used in the headline is false.
The original hoax from The Rightists.
Four of the five most successful posts from the Macedonian sites BuzzFeed News identified are false. They include the false claim that the pope endorsed Trump, and the false claim that Mike Pence said Michelle Obama is the ""most vulgar first lady we've ever had."" Those four posts together generated more than 1 million shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. That resulted in huge traffic and significant ad revenue for the owners of these sites, with many people being misinformed along the way.
The Macedonians BuzzFeed News spoke to said the explosion in pro-Trump sites in Veles means the market has now become crowded, making it harder to earn money. The people who launched their sites early in 2016 are making the most money, according to the university student. He said a friend of his earns $5,000 per month, ""or even $3,000 per day"" when he gets a hit on Facebook.
The 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com with a partner said he also runs health websites in addition to the US politics site. They launched the site in early 2016 and it's now averaging 1 million page views a month, said his partner. (The teens declined to share revenue figures.)
The 17-year-old and his three partners are still waiting for Google's AdSense program to approve their site for ads. As of now, they're only generating about 800 views a day and aren't earning any revenue. The university student launched his site in August and stopped updating it in order to focus on another, more successful site he has that's focused on health and well-being. He estimated there are ""thousands"" of health-related sites being run out of Veles. US politics is just this year's opportunity, thanks to a combination of Trump and Facebook.
""I stopped because I didn't really enjoy doing it and we didn't actually make any money from it since there are so many people posting already,"" the university student said. ""The people who started early are the ones reaping the rewards.""
Aside from the allure of easy money, they also have an element of pride that web-savvy people — including teenagers — in a small country like Macedonia can earn money by gaming Facebook, Google, and Americans.
""A good chunk of the world thinks Macedonia is primitive, but that is not true,"" the 17-year-old said.
The young men running these sites know the Trump traffic bonanza will soon come to an end. They expect traffic and revenue to decline significantly once the election is over. But they also hold out hope that a Trump win will keep their sites afloat.
""If Trump loses I plan to redirect my site to sports,"" the 16-year-old's partner said. ""It means that there will be no more politics [worth covering].""

Paragraphs:
On Wikipedia, trusted users may be appointed as administrators (also referred to as admins, sysops or janitors),[1]: 327  following a successful request for adminship. Currently, there are 847 administrators on the English Wikipedia.[2] Administrators have additional technical privileges compared with other editors, such as being able to protect and delete pages and being able to block users from editing pages.
On Wikipedia, becoming an administrator is often referred to as ""being given [or taking up] the mop"",[3] a term which has also been used elsewhere.[4] In 2006, The New York Times reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were ""geographically diverse"".[5] In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was ""running out of administrators"", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed administrators each month, but in the first half of 2012, only nine in total were appointed.[6][7]
However, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder, denied that this was a crisis or that Wikipedia was running out of admins, saying, ""The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on.""[8] Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is ""not a big deal"", and that ""It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone.""[9]
In his 2008 book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual, John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role.[10] Instead, he says, admins usually ""delete pages"" and ""protect pages involved in edit wars"".[10] Wikipedia administrators are not employees or agents of the Wikimedia Foundation.[11]
While the first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales in October 2001,[12] administrator privileges on Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA).[1] Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. The process has been said to be ""akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court"" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. Lih also said, ""It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point"", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was ""prove you weren't a bozo"".[6]
Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after ""extensive work on the wiki"".[1] While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision that can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a ""request"" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators.[13] This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et al. quoted that ""Prior to mid-2005, RfAs typically did not attract much attention. Since then, it has become quite common for RfAs to attract huge numbers of RfA groupies who all support one another"",[14] with the record number of votes in one RfA as of May 2022 being 468 for the RfA of longtime editor Tamzin Hadasa Kelly, which was supported by 340 users and opposed by 116 amidst controversy over their criticism of supporters of Donald Trump.[15]
Once granted administrator privileges, a user has access to additional functions in order to perform certain duties.[6] These include ""messy cleanup work"",[1] deletion of articles deemed unsuitable, protecting pages (restricting editing privileges to that page),[16]: 66  and blocking the accounts of disruptive users.[1][6] Blocking a user must be done according to Wikipedia's policies and a reason must be stated for the block, which will be permanently logged by the software.[1]: 401 [16]: 120  Use of this privilege to ""gain editing advantages"" is considered inappropriate.[1]
A 2013 scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors.[17] This corresponds to a modality of plural voting. Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007, with the goal of determining which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's Guide to requests for adminship[18] were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin.[4] In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw, which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. They found that they could ""classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates.""[19]

Paragraphs:
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.[1] Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide Web using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
Scraping a web page involves fetching it and then extracting data from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Having fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may be parsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping).
As well as contact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used for web indexing, web mining and data mining, online price change monitoring and price comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring, website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation, web mashup, and web data integration.
Web pages are built using text-based mark-up languages (HTML and XHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for human end-users and not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Web scraping applications include market research, price comparison, content monitoring, and more. Businesses rely on web scraping services to efficiently gather and utilize this data.
Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers. For example, JSON is commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server.
There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, web scraping systems use techniques involving DOM parsing, computer vision and natural language processing to simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing.
After the birth of the World Wide Web in 1989, the first web robot,[2] World Wide Web Wanderer, was created in June 1993, which was intended only to measure the size of the web.
In December 1993, the first crawler-based web search engine, JumpStation, was launched. As there were fewer websites available on the web, search engines at that time used to rely on human administrators to collect and format links. In comparison, JumpStation was the first WWW search engine to rely on a web robot.
In 2000, the first Web API and API crawler were created. An API (Application Programming Interface) is an interface that makes it much easier to develop a program by providing the building blocks. In 2000, Salesforce and eBay launched their own API, with which programmers could access and download some of the data available to the public. Since then, many websites offer web APIs for people to access their public database.
Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with the semantic web vision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence and human-computer interactions.
The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation.
A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIX grep command or regular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instance Perl or Python).
Static and dynamic web pages can be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server using socket programming.
Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called a wrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[3] Moreover, some semi-structured data query languages, such as XQuery and the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content.
By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as the Internet Explorer or the Mozilla browser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such as Xpath can be used to parse the resulting DOM tree.
There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of ""bots"" for specific verticals with no ""man in the loop"" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target the Long Tail of sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from.
The pages being scraped may embrace metadata or semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, as Microformat does, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[4] are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages.
There are efforts using machine learning and computer vision that attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[5]
Uses advanced AI to interpret and process web page content contextually, extracting relevant information, transforming data, and customizing outputs based on the content's structure and meaning. This method enables more intelligent and flexible data extraction, accommodating complex and dynamic web content.
The world of web scraping offers a variety of software tools designed to simplify and customize the process of data extraction from websites. These tools vary in their approach and capabilities, making web scraping accessible to both novice users and advanced programmers.
Some advanced web scraping software can automatically recognize the data structure of a web page, eliminating the need for manual coding. Others provide a recording interface that allows users to record their interactions with a website, thus creating a scraping script without writing a single line of code. Many tools also include scripting functions for more customized extraction and transformation of content, along with database interfaces to store the scraped data locally.
Web scraping tools are versatile in their functionality. Some can directly extract data from APIs, while others are capable of handling websites with AJAX-based dynamic content loading or login requirements. Point-and-click software, for instance, empowers users without advanced coding skills to benefit from web scraping. This democratizes access to data, making it easier for a broader audience to leverage the power of web scraping.
Some platforms provide not only tools for web scraping but also opportunities for developers to share and potentially monetize their scraping solutions. By leveraging these tools and platforms, users can unlock the full potential of web scraping, turning raw data into valuable insights and opportunities.
[6]
The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against the terms of service of some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[7]
In the United States, website owners can use three major legal claims to prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (""CFAA""), and (3) trespass to chattel.[8] However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled in Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service that duplication of facts is allowable.
U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of ""scrapers"" or ""robots"" may be held liable for committing trespass to chattels,[9][10] which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases, eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known as auction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass to chattels, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[11]
One of the first major tests of screen scraping involved American Airlines (AA), and a firm called FareChase.[12] AA successfully obtained an injunction from a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[13]
Southwest Airlines has also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of ""Computer Fraud and Abuse"" and has led to ""Damage and Loss"" and ""Unauthorized Access"" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes ""Interference with Business Relations"", ""Trespass"", and ""Harmful Access by Computer"". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as ""Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment"", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should be US Copyright law and that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in the Supreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent company Yahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[14] In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, in Craigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).
Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[15]
While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in the Cvent, Inc. v. Eventbrite, Inc. In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for a browse wrap contract or license to be enforced.[16] In a 2014 case, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[17] e-commerce site QVC objected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly ""excessively crawled"" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[18] QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly.
In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[19]
In Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[20][21] In Associated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater.
The Ninth Circuit ruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA in hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. The case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision in Van Buren v. United States which narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[22] On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[23]
Internet Archive collects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.[citation needed]
In February 2006, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court (Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[24]
In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates the inchoate state of developing case law. In the case of Ryanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland's High Court ruled Ryanair's ""click-wrap"" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, Justice Michael Hanna ruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[25] The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[26]
On April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[27] The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[28]
In Australia, the Spam Act 2003 outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[29][30]
Leaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate the Information Technology Act, 2000, which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource.
The administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot. Some techniques include:

Blocking an IP address either manually or based on criteria such as geolocation and DNSRBL. This will also block all browsing from that address.
Disabling any web service API that the website's system might expose.
Bots sometimes declare who they are (using user agent strings) and can be blocked on that basis using robots.txt; 'googlebot' is an example. Other bots make no distinction between themselves and a human using a browser.
Bots can be blocked by monitoring excess traffic
Bots can sometimes be blocked with tools to verify that it is a real person accessing the site, like a CAPTCHA. Bots are sometimes coded to explicitly break specific CAPTCHA patterns or may employ third-party services that utilize human labor to read and respond in real-time to CAPTCHA challenges. They can be triggered because the bot is: 1) making too many requests in a short time, 2) using low-quality proxies, or 3) not covering the web scraper’s fingerprint properly.[31]
Commercial anti-bot services: Companies offer anti-bot and anti-scraping services for websites. A few web application firewalls have limited bot detection capabilities as well. However, many such solutions are not very effective.[32]
Locating bots with a honeypot or other method to identify the IP addresses of automated crawlers.
Obfuscation using CSS sprites to display such data as telephone numbers or email addresses, at the cost of accessibility to screen reader users.
Because bots rely on consistency in the front-end code of a target website, adding small variations to the HTML/CSS surrounding important data and navigation elements would require more human involvement in the initial set up of a bot and if done effectively may render the target website too difficult to scrape due to the diminished ability to automate the scraping process.
Websites can declare if crawling is allowed or not in the robots.txt file and allow partial access, limit the crawl rate, specify the optimal time to crawl and more.

Paragraphs:

Wikipedia[c] is a free content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers, known as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history,[3][4] and is consistently ranked among the ten most visited websites; as of August 2024[update], it was ranked fourth by Semrush,[5] and seventh by Similarweb.[6] Founded by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[7]
Initially only available in English, editions of Wikipedia in more than 300 other languages have been developed. The English Wikipedia, with its over 6.9 million articles, is the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 63 million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024[update].[W 1] In July 2024, over 25% of Wikipedia's traffic was from the United States, followed by Japan at 6.2%, the United Kingdom at 5.8%, Russia at 5.2%, Germany at 5%, and the remaining 51% split among other countries.[8]
Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, and culture. It has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[9][10] While the reliability of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise from the late 2010s onward[3][11][12] while becoming an important fact-checking site.[13][14] Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site.[15][16] Articles on breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]
Various collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before the start of Wikipedia, but with limited success.[19] Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process.[20] It was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.[1][21] Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia Open Content License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the GNU Free Documentation License at the urging of Richard Stallman.[W 2] Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[22][W 3] while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[W 4] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a ""feeder"" project for Nupedia.[W 5]
Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001[20] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[W 6] and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[22] The name originated from a blend of the words wiki and encyclopedia.[23][24] Its integral policy of ""neutral point-of-view""[W 7] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.[22] Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.[25]
Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[W 8][W 9] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of 2 million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made in China during the Ming dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[26]
Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[W 10] Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[27][W 11]
After an early period of exponential growth,[28] the growth rate of the English Wikipedia in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[29] The edition reached 3 million articles in August 2009. Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[W 12] A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to ""increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits"".[28] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called ""low-hanging fruit""—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.[30][31][32]
In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.[33][34] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.[35] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.[36] Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from ""a little more than 36,000 writers"" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was ""stable and sustainable"".[37] A 2013 MIT Technology Review article, ""The Decline of Wikipedia"", questioned this claim, reporting that since 2007 Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and suggesting that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.[38] In July 2012, The Atlantic reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.[39] In the November 25, 2013, issue of New York magazine, Katherine Ward stated, ""Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.""[40] The number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.[41][42]
In January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten most popular websites in the United States, according to Comscore Networks.[43] With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing The New York Times (#10) and Apple (#11).[43] This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.[44] In 2014, it received 8 billion page views every month.[W 13] On February 9, 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ""according to the ratings firm comScore"".[45] As of March 2023[update], it ranked 6th in popularity, according to Similarweb.[46] Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through ""stigmergic accumulation"".[47][48]
On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the United States Congress—the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA)—by blacking out its pages for 24 hours.[49] More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.[50][W 14]
In January 2013, 274301 Wikipedia, an asteroid, was named after Wikipedia;[51] in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the Wikipedia Monument;[52] and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as Print Wikipedia.[53] In April 2019, an Israeli lunar lander, Beresheet, crash landed on the surface of the Moon carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.[54][55] In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into synthetic DNA.[56]
On January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for The Economic Times indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it ""had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about 2 billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost 9 percent.""[57] Varma added, ""While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's Knowledge Graphs project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.""[57] When contacted on this matter, Clay Shirky, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, ""If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].""[57] By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.[58] As of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,[59] from which cloud computing was the most cited page.[60]
On January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called ""Vector 2022"".[61][62] It featured a redesigned menu bar, moving the table of contents to the left as a sidebar, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.[62][W 15] The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the Swahili Wikipedia unanimously voted to revert the changes.[61][63]
Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.[64]
Due to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[W 16] On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.[W 17][65] A frequently vandalized article can be ""semi-protected"" or ""extended confirmed protected"", meaning that only ""autoconfirmed"" or ""extended confirmed"" editors can modify it.[W 17] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators can make changes.[W 18] A 2021 article in the Columbia Journalism Review identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as ""perhaps the most important"" means at its disposal to ""regulate its market of ideas"".[66]
In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains ""stable versions"" of articles which have passed certain reviews.[W 19] Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the ""pending changes"" system in December 2012.[67] Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.[68] However, restrictions on editing may reduce the editor engagement as well as efforts to diversity the editing community.[69]
Although changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.[e][70] On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a ""watchlist"" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.[W 20] ""New pages patrol"" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.[W 21]
In 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored ""creative construction"" over ""creative destruction"".[71]
Any change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.[72] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.[W 22]
Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.[73][74] However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.[75]
In the Seigenthaler biography incident, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure John Seigenthaler in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.[75] It remained uncorrected for four months.[75] Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of USA Today and founder of the Freedom Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.[76][77] After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as ""a flawed and irresponsible research tool"".[75] The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.[78]
Wikipedia editors often have disagreements regarding content, which can be discussed on article Talk pages. Disputes may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as ""edit warring"".[W 23][79] It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,[80] and criticized as creating a competitive[81] and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles.[82][83] Research has focused on, for example, impoliteness of disputes,[84][85] the influence of rival editing camps,[86][87] the conversational structure,[88] and the shift in conflicts to a focus on sources.[89][90]
Taha Yasseri of the University of Oxford examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.[91][92] Yasseri contended that simple reverts or ""undo"" operations were not the most significant measure of counterproductive work behavior at Wikipedia. He relied instead on ""mutually reverting edit pairs"", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles George W. Bush, anarchism, and Muhammad.[92] By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering Croatia, Scientology, and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[92] In 2020, researchers identified other measures of editor behaviors, beyond mutual reverts, to identify editing conflicts across Wikipedia.[93]
Editors also debate the deletion of articles on Wikipedia, with roughly 500,000 such debates since Wikipedia's inception. Once an article is nominated for deletion, the dispute is typically determined by initial votes (to keep or delete) and by reference to topic-specific notability policies.[94]
Content in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, copyright laws) of the United States and of the US state of Virginia, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.[W 24][W 25] By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.[W 26][W 27] In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the ""official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation"".[W 28]
The fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the ""Five pillars"", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.[W 29] The five pillars are:
The rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.[95] Editors can enforce the rules by deleting or modifying non-compliant material.[W 30] Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.[W 19]
According to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is encyclopedic and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.[W 31] A topic should also meet Wikipedia's standards of ""notability"", which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.[W 32] Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.[W 33] It must not present original research.[W 34] A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.[W 31] Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as ""verifiability, not truth"" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.[W 35] This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.[96] Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.[W 36] As Wikipedia policies changed over time, and became more complex, their number has grown. In 2008, there were 44 policy pages and 248 guideline pages; by 2013, scholars counted 383 policy pages and 449 guideline pages.[97]
Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.[98][99] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.[W 37]
Editors in good standing in the community can request extra user rights, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for ""adminship"",[100] which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.[W 38] Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.[W 38]
By 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.[101] In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.[102]
Wikipedia has delegated some administrative functions to bots, such as when granting privileges to human editors. Such algorithmic governance has an ease of implementation and scaling, though the automated rejection of edits may have contributed to a downturn in active Wikipedia editors.[97]
Over time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a ""request for comment"".[W 23]
Wikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in consensus building in the field.[103] Joseph Reagle and Sue Gardner argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by Quakers.[103]: 62  A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a facilitator in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.[103]: 83 
The Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.[104] Statistical analyses suggest that the English Wikipedia committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,[105] functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.[104]
Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).[f] Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).[104] Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and anti-social behavior.[W 39] When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.[104]
Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated ""talk"" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.[106] Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike,[107] although not always with entirely negative connotations.[108] Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as ""anti-elitism"".[W 40]
Wikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.[109] As Wikipedia grew, ""Who writes Wikipedia?"" became one of the questions frequently asked there.[110] Jimmy Wales once argued that only ""a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers"" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore ""much like any traditional organization"".[111] In 2008, a Slate magazine article reported that: ""According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.""[112] This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by Aaron Swartz, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.[113]
The English Wikipedia has 6,905,069 articles, 48,204,582 registered editors, and 120,034 active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.[W 41] Editors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a ""baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references"".[114] Editors who do not log in are in some sense ""second-class citizens"" on Wikipedia,[114] as ""participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation"",[115] but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their IP addresses cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.[115]
A 2007 study by researchers from Dartmouth College found that ""anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site"".[116] Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that ""[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users ... 524 people ... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.""[111] However, Business Insider editor and journalist Henry Blodget showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by ""outsiders"", while most editing and formatting is done by ""insiders"".[111]
A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[117] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.[118] According to a 2009 study, there is ""evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content"".[119]
Several studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.[120] Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.[121] Similarly, many of these universities, including Yale and Brown, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.[121] Andrew Lih, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to ""ugly, intimidating behavior"".[122] Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.[123]
Distribution of the 63,891,853 articles in different language editions (as of November 2, 2024)[W 42]
There are currently 339 language editions of Wikipedia (also called language versions, or simply Wikipedias). As of November 2024, the six largest, in order of article count, are the English, Cebuano, German, French, Swedish, and Dutch Wikipedias.[W 43] The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot Lsjbot, which as of 2013[update] had created about half the articles on the Swedish Wikipedia, and most of the articles in the Cebuano and Waray Wikipedias. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.
In addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (Russian, Spanish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Waray, Arabic, and Portuguese), seven more have over 500,000 articles (Persian, Catalan, Indonesian, Serbian, Korean, Norwegian, and Turkish), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.[W 44][W 43] The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.9 million articles. As of January 2021,[update] the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.[W 45]
Since Wikipedia is based on the Web and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over spelling differences (e.g. colour versus color)[W 46] or points of view.[W 47]
Though the various language editions are held to global policies such as ""neutral point of view"", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not licensed freely may be used under a claim of fair use.[W 48][125]
Jimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as ""an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language"".[W 49] Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).[W 50] For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,[W 51] and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.[W 52] The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.[W 52] It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.[W 32]
Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer ""interwiki links"", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.[127][W 53]
A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the Simple English Wikipedia.[126]
On March 1, 2014, The Economist, in an article titled ""The Future of Wikipedia"", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that ""the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.""[128] The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by The Economist as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). The Economist reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.[128]
In contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.[128]
Various Wikipedians have criticized Wikipedia's large and growing regulation, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.[update][129][103] Critics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits systemic bias. In 2010, columnist and journalist Edwin Black described Wikipedia as being a mixture of ""truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods"".[130] Articles in The Chronicle of Higher Education and The Journal of Academic Librarianship have criticized Wikipedia's ""undue-weight policy"", concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.[131][132][133]
Journalists Oliver Kamm and Edwin Black alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an ""ax to grind"" on the topic.[130][134] A 2008 article in Education Next journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and spin.[135] In 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that ""Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.""[136]
Multiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being ideologically biased. In February 2021, Fox News accused Wikipedia of whitewashing communism and socialism and having too much ""leftist bias"".[137] Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a ""propaganda"" for the left-leaning ""establishment"" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.[138] In 2022, libertarian John Stossel opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.[139] Some studies suggest that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a ""western cultural bias"" (or ""pro-western bias"")[140] or ""Eurocentric bias"",[141] reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, ""similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography"". Carwil Bjork-James proposes that Wikipedia could follow the diversification pattern of contemporary scholarship [142] and Dangzhi Zhao calls for a ""decolonization"" of Wikipedia to reduce bias from opinionated White male editors.[143]
Articles for traditional encyclopedias such as Encyclopædia Britannica are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.[144] However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and Encyclopædia Britannica by the science journal Nature found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that ""the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; Britannica, about three.""[145] Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects ""a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors"" in science articles, ""Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.""[146]
Others raised similar critiques.[147] The findings by Nature were disputed by Encyclopædia Britannica,[148][149] and in response, Nature gave a rebuttal of the points raised by Britannica.[150] In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the Nature effort, and suggested a ""flawed study design"" (in Nature's manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported confidence intervals), and a lack of study ""statistical power"" (i.e., owing to small sample size, 42 or 4 × 101 articles compared, vs >105 and >106 set sizes for Britannica and the English Wikipedia, respectively).[151]
As a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia ""makes no guarantee of validity"" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.[W 54] Concerns have been raised by PC World in 2009 regarding the lack of accountability that results from users' anonymity, the insertion of false information,[152] vandalism, and similar problems. Legal Research in a Nutshell (2011), cites Wikipedia as a ""general source"" that ""can be a real boon"" in ""coming up to speed in the law governing a situation"" and, ""while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources"".[153]
Economist Tyler Cowen wrote: ""If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia."" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.[154] Amy Bruckman has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, ""the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created"".[155] In September 2022, The Sydney Morning Herald journalist Liam Mannix noted that: ""There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate ... And yet it [is]."" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as Encyclopædia Britannica, summarizing that ""...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.""[156]
Critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.[157] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.[158] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclopædia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[159] Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of ""fake news"" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.[160]
Wikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for Internet trolls, spammers, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.[70][W 55] In response to paid advocacy editing and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in The Wall Street Journal to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.[162] The article stated that: ""Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. Katherine Maher, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.'""[162][163][164][165][166] These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by Stephen Colbert on The Colbert Report.[167]
Some university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[168] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[169][170] Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[171] Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten emails weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. ""For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia"", he said.[172][173]
In February 2007, an article in The Harvard Crimson newspaper reported that a few of the professors at Harvard University were including Wikipedia articles in their syllabi, although without realizing the articles might change.[174] In June 2007, Michael Gorman, former president of the American Library Association, condemned Wikipedia, along with Google, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are ""the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything"".[175]
A 2020 research study published in Studies in Higher Education argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education ""flipped classroom"", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.[176]
On March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for The Atlantic magazine in an article titled ""Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia"", stated that ""Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.""[177] Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of Amin Azzam at the University of San Francisco to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve Wikipedia articles on health-related issues, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by James Heilman to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.[177] In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in The Atlantic titled ""Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?"", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: ""Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.""[178] Beck added that: ""Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.""[178]
Wikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has terabytes of disk space, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.[W 56] The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see deletionism and inclusionism).[179][180] Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.[W 57] The ""Wikipedia is not censored"" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of images of Muhammad in the English edition of its Muhammad article, citing this policy.[181] The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the censorship of Wikipedia by national authorities in China[182] and Pakistan,[183] among other countries.[184][185][186]
Through its ""Wikipedia Loves Libraries"" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.[187] A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the University of Minnesota indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the ""people and arts"" category, while males focus more on ""geography and science"".[188]
Research conducted by Mark Graham of the Oxford Internet Institute in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.[189] Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.[190]
An editorial in The Guardian in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for a list of female porn actors than a list of women writers.[191] Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in Cape Town sought to address.[123]
Academic studies of Wikipedia have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the ""average Wikipedian"", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15–49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.[192] This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.[193][194] This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, gender bias, and geographical bias on Wikipedia.[195][196] There are two broad types of bias, which are implicit (when a topic is omitted) and explicit (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).[193]
Interdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.[195] In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example ""biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare"".[37] The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's Technology Review titled ""The Decline of Wikipedia"" discussed the effect of systemic bias and policy creep on the downward trend in the number of editors.[38]
Wikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.[197] Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.[W 58] The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.[W 59]
The Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer—a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a ""blacklist"" it supplies to British internet service providers.[198]
In April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law.[199][200] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted ""obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children"", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.[201] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.[201] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.[202]
Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[203] saying that Wikipedia did not have ""material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.""[203] Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".[204] Critics, including Wikipediocracy, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.[205]
One privacy concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a ""private citizen"" rather than a ""public figure"" in the eyes of the law.[206][g] It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in cyberspace and the right to be anonymous in real life. The Wikimedia Foundation's privacy policy states, ""we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement"", and states that ""personal information"" may be shared ""For legal reasons"", ""To Protect You, Ourselves & Others"", or ""To Understand & Experiment"".[W 60]
In January 2006, a German court ordered the German Wikipedia shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of Boris Floricic, aka ""Tron"", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's right to privacy or that of his parents was being violated.[207]
Wikipedia has a "" Volunteer Response Team"" that uses Znuny, a free and open-source software fork of OTRS[W 61] to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.[W 62]
In late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.[208]
Wikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of sexism and harassment.[209][210] The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.[211] Edit-a-thons have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.[212]
In May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about Donna Strickland due to lack of coverage in the media.[W 63][213] Five months later, Strickland won a Nobel Prize in Physics ""for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics"", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.[213][214] Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award Gérard Mourou.[213] Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for Quartz argued that ""it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.""[215] Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.[215]
A comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of Stony Brook University's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of Carnegie Mellon University found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. ""Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.""[216]
Wikipedia is hosted and funded by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as Wiktionary and Wikibooks.[W 64] The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.[217][W 65] The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service Form 990 shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.[W 66]
In May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named Lila Tretikov as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.[W 67] The Wall Street Journal reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, ""Information, like air, wants to be free.""[218][219] The same Wall Street Journal article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who ""said Tretikov would address that issue (paid advocacy) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency ... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities"", Walsh said.[218]
Following the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the ""superprotection"" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,[W 68] Katherine Maher became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.[W 69] Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to Bloomberg Businessweek regarding the harassment issue that: ""It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority ... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.""[122]
Maher served as executive director until April 2021.[220] Maryana Iskander was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.[221]
Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates. These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.[W 70]
The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.[W 71] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.[W 72] MediaWiki is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.[W 71][W 73] Originally, Wikipedia ran on UseModWiki written in Perl by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required CamelCase for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.[W 74] Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a PHP wiki engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by Magnus Manske. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the exponentially increasing demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by Lee Daniel Crocker.
Several MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.[W 75] In April 2005, a Lucene extension[W 76][W 77] was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on Elasticsearch.[W 78] In July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) extension, VisualEditor, was opened to public use.[222][223][224] It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as ""slow and buggy"".[225] The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.[W 79]
Computer programs called bots have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.[W 80][226][227] One controversial contributor, Sverker Johansson, created articles with his bot Lsjbot, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.[228] Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).[W 81] Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.[226] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.[229] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.[W 82] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.[230]
As of 2021,[update] page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of Varnish caching servers and back-end layer caching is done by Apache Traffic Server.[W 83] Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the Linux Virtual Server software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.[W 83] The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.[231]
Wikipedia currently runs on dedicated clusters of Linux servers running the Debian operating system.[W 84] By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an Equinix facility in Ashburn, Virginia.[W 85][232] In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in Singapore, the first of its kind in Asia.[W 86] In 2022, a caching data center was opened in Marseille, France.[W 87] As of February 2023,[update] caching clusters are located in Amsterdam, San Francisco, Singapore, and Marseille.[W 25][W 88]
Following growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,[38] the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of industrial organization economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.[233] Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the ""Thank"" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.[38][225] The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by Adam Jaffe, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.[234] At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,[W 89] the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.[234] In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,[W 90] updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.[234]
Multiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. Wikimedia's online newspaper The Signpost was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.[235][236] The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and Wikipedia's sister projects.[W 91]
The Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of digital publications, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.[237][238] Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when ICE Publishing joined in 2020, a spokesman said ""By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.""[239]
When the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), a copyleft license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.[W 24] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.[240] In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.[W 92] Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.[W 93] In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.[W 94][W 95][W 96][W 97]
The handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under fair use doctrine,[W 98] while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in Japanese copyright law). Media files covered by free content licenses (e.g. Creative Commons' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via Wikimedia Commons repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.[W 99] Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.[241] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.[242][243]
Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.[W 100] The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.
Thousands of ""mirror sites"" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are Reference.com and Answers.com.[244][245] Another example is Wapedia, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.[W 101] Some web search engines make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include Microsoft Bing (via technology gained from Powerset)[246] and DuckDuckGo.
Collections of Wikipedia articles have been published on optical discs. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.[W 102] The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,[W 103] the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,[W 104] and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.[W 105] Additionally, ""Wikipedia for Schools"", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and SOS Children, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.[W 106]
There have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.[247][W 107] Since 2009, tens of thousands of print-on-demand books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company Books LLC and by three Mauritian subsidiaries of the German publisher VDM.[248]
The website DBpedia, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.[249] Wikimedia has created the Wikidata project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable semantic format, RDF.[W 108] As of February 2023,[update] it has over 101 million items.[W 109] WikiReader is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by OpenMoko and first released in 2009.[W 110]
Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.[W 111] Wikipedia publishes ""dumps"" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,[update] there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.[W 112] Wikimedia Enterprise is a for-profit solution to this.[250]
Several languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the Journal of Documentation, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library reference desk, with an accuracy of 55 percent.[251]
Wikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard web browser through a fixed Internet connection. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the mobile web since July 2013, The New York Times on February 9, 2014, quoted Erik Möller, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in The New York Times reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, ""Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more."" In 2014 The New York Times reported that Möller has assigned ""a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile"", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by The New York Times for the ""worry"" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.[45] By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.[7]
Access to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), via the Wapedia service.[W 101] In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the iPhone, Android-based devices, or WebOS-based devices.[W 113] Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia metadata like geoinformation.[252][253]
The Android app for Wikipedia was released in January 2012, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.[W 114][W 115] The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.[W 116] Wikipedia Zero was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.[W 117][254] It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.[W 117]
Andrew Lih and Andrew Brown both maintain editing Wikipedia with smartphones is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.[255][256] Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,[255] and Tom Simonite of MIT Technology Review claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some Wikipedians use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the status quo.[38] Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.[255][256]
Access to Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015.[16][257][258] This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.[259]
In 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.[13][14] Noam Cohen, writing in The Washington Post states, ""YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out 'fake news'.""[14][260]
In February 2014, The New York Times reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating ""With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month, ... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.""[45] However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.[261] The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.[262]
In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[W 118] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[263] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[W 119] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[264] In 2011, Business Insider gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.[265]
According to ""Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011"", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.[W 120] As of February 2023,[update] Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion pageviews each month.[W 1]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.[266][267][268][269] Noam Cohen wrote in Wired that Wikipedia's effort to combat misinformation related to the pandemic was different from other major websites, opining, ""Unless Twitter, Facebook and the others can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.""[267] In October 2020, the World Health Organization announced they were freely licensing its infographics and other materials on Wikimedia projects.[270] There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.[update][271][272]
Wikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.[W 121][273][274] The Parliament of Canada's website refers to Wikipedia's article on same-sex marriage in the ""related links"" section of its ""further reading"" list for the Civil Marriage Act.[275] The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the World Intellectual Property Organization[276]—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.[277] Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some US intelligence agency reports.[278] In December 2008, the scientific journal RNA Biology launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the RNA family for publication in Wikipedia.[279] Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[280][281] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[282][283][284][285]
In 2006, Time magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with YouTube, Reddit, MySpace, and Facebook) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.[286] On September 16, 2007, The Washington Post reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the 2008 US election campaign, saying: ""Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.""[287] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled ""Wikipedia page the latest status symbol"", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[288]
One of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when Italian politician Franco Grillini raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of freedom of panorama. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, ""the seventh most consulted website"", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.[289]
A working group led by Peter Stone (formed as a part of the Stanford-based project One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence) in its report called Wikipedia ""the best-known example of crowdsourcing ... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth"".[290][291]
In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as ""one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web"" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having ""since colonized the web for television's values"". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers ""endangered"" due to the ""gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment"". Rather than ""sapere aude"" (lit. 'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of ""dare not to care to know"". This is while Wikipedia faces ""a more concerning problem"" than funding, namely ""a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website"". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to ""save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.""[292]
Wikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.[W 122] The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual Prix Ars Electronica contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' Webby Award for the ""community"" category.[293]
In 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question ""Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?""[294]
In September 2008, Wikipedia received Quadriga A Mission of Enlightenment award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with Boris Tadić, Eckart Höfling, and Peter Gabriel. The award was presented to Wales by David Weinberger.[295]
In 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual Erasmus Prize, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,[296] and the Spanish Princess of Asturias Award on International Cooperation.[297] Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, Jimmy Wales praised the work of the Asturian Wikipedia users.[298]
Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning ""together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on"".[167] Another example can be found in ""Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence"", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion,[299] as well as the 2010 The Onion article ""'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today"".[300]
In an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy The Office, office manager (Michael Scott) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on negotiation tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.[301] Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.[302]
""My Number One Doctor"", a 2007 episode of the television show Scrubs, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which Perry Cox reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the raw food diet reverses the effects of bone cancer by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the Battlestar Galactica episode guide.[303]
In 2008, the comedy website CollegeHumor produced a video sketch named ""Professor Wikipedia"", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.[304] The Dilbert comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying ""Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.""[305] In July 2009, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a comedy series called Bigipedia, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.[306] Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.[307]
On August 23, 2013, the New Yorker website published a cartoon with this caption: ""Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?""[308] The cartoon referred to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American activist, politician, and former United States Army soldier who had recently come out as a trans woman.[309]
In June 2024, nature.com published a fictional Wikipedia Talk page under the title ""Plastic-eating fungus caused doomsday"" by Emma Burnett. The Talk page concerned a fictional article describing the unintended consequences of the release of a plastic-eating fungus to clean up an oil spill. The article contained Talk page topics found on Wikipedia, like discussions of changes in the articles priority level.[310]
Wikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation. These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[W 123] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,[311] Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,[W 124] Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,[W 125] Wikinews, for collaborative journalism,[W 126] and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.[W 127] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing.[312] In 2012, Wikivoyage, an editable travel guide,[313] and Wikidata, an editable knowledge base, launched.[W 128]
The most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like Encyclopædia Britannica, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.[314][315][316] Nicholas Carr's 2005 essay ""The amorality of Web 2.0"" criticizes websites with user-generated content (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because ""free trumps quality all the time"". Carr wrote, ""Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.""[317] Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. Chris Anderson, the former editor-in-chief of Wired, wrote in Nature that the ""wisdom of crowds"" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top scientific journals with rigorous peer review processes.[318]
Wikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen BookScan stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping ""far more sharply"".[319] Kathryn Hughes, professor of life writing at the University of East Anglia and author of two biographies wrote, ""The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?""[319]
Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing.[320][321] In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called ""wikification"",[322] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.[323] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find ""missing"" links in Wikipedia.[324]
In 2015, French researchers José Lages of the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon and Dima Shepelyansky of Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.[325][326][327] They used PageRank, CheiRank and similar algorithms ""followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)"".[327][328] The study was updated in 2019.[329]
In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia ""at least a dozen times a day"", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as ""a work of reference as useful as any in existence"", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.[330]
A 2017 MIT study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.[331][332] Studies related to Wikipedia have been using machine learning and artificial intelligence[291] to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism[333][334] and data quality assessment in Wikipedia.[335][336]
In February 2022, civil servants from the UK's Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee were found to have used Wikipedia for research after journalists at The Independent noted that parts of the document had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on Constantinople and the list of largest cities throughout history.[337]
Several interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 BBC Domesday Project, which included text (entered on BBC Micro computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.[338]
Several free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. Everything2),[339] with many later being merged into the project (e.g. GNE).[W 129] One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was h2g2, which was created by Douglas Adams in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.[340]
Subsequent collaborative knowledge websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional peer review, such as Encyclopedia of Life and the online wiki encyclopedias Scholarpedia and Citizendium.[341][342] The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.[343][344]

There is a certain mindset associated with unmoderated Usenet groups [...] that infects the collectively-managed Wikipedia project: if you react strongly to trolling, that reflects poorly on you, not (necessarily) on the troll. If you [...] demand that something be done about constant disruption by trollish behavior, the other listmembers will cry ""censorship"", attack you, and even come to the defense of the troll. [...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise are tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.)

Harris and Trump Battle to the Wire in Swing States, Times/Siena Polls Find
Donald Trump has improved his standing in Pennsylvania even as late-deciding voters appear to be breaking for Kamala Harris.

Some Surprises in Last Battleground Polls, but Still Pointing to Deadlock
The race remains essentially even across the seven states likeliest to decide the presidency.

A Deeper Look at the Numbers
Ruth Igielnik
The gender gap continues to be massive this election. Harris is winning women by 16 percentage points in battleground states while Trump wins men by the same margin. For the first time, abortion is the most important issue for women in deciding their vote. For men, the economy is the top concern.
Ruth Igielnik
Harris is winning young voters by 17 percentage points in battleground states. That is a substantial improvement over Joe Biden’s standing with young voters earlier this year. But Harris still slightly lags Biden’s 2020 numbers with young voters, many of whom are struggling to decide up until the end.
Lisa Lerer
There are still voters to be persuaded, even at this late hour in the race. The poll shows that 11 percent of voters remained undecided, down from 16 percent about a month ago.
Ruth Igielnik
The poll finds that in some states nearly half of voters have already voted. Harris is winning those voters in six of the seven states, while Trump is winning them in Arizona.
Ruth Igielnik
All eyes are on Pennsylvania, where Trump and Harris are deadlocked. The last three Times/Siena polls had Harris +4 in the state, suggesting the race has narrowed significantly in the state that might be key to victory for either candidate.
Maya King
Harris has a slight edge over Trump in Georgia. Her campaign has invested millions in the state in the hopes of building on Biden’s narrow 2020 win in the state. Harris rallied thousands near downtown Atlanta yesterday.
Katie Glueck
Harris and Trump are deadlocked in Michigan, a crucial battleground state that Biden won in 2020 and Trump won in 2016. Harris is campaigning in Michigan today, while Trump has a rally scheduled in Grand Rapids tomorrow night.
Jennifer Medina
Harris is narrowly ahead of Trump in Nevada. Democrats have been anxiously analyzing early voting patterns in the state and are now relying on a heavy turnout in Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the majority of the state’s Democrats.
Jonathan Swan
The final batch of public polls has set off a round of late second-guessing among some Trump allies. But Trump’s core team remains convinced that these public polls are underestimating his support and that he is on track to win.

Paragraphs:
Fake news refers to false or misleading information which masquerades as legitimate news. Generally, fake news falls into two categories:
Misinformation isn’t a new phenomenon – the term “fake news” was actually used in the 19th century – but the internet and soI don’cial media have transformed how it’s created and spread. Pre-internet, people tended to receive their news from trusted media sources whose journalists were required to follow strict codes of practice. The internet enabled new ways to publish, share and consume news and information, with relatively little regulation or editorial standards. Many people now consume news from social media and other online sources – but it’s not always easy to determine which stories are credible and which are false.
There are different types of fake news, depending on the motivation of those who create it. For example:
Sensationalism sells, and outrageous or weird stories and distorted images drive clicks and shares online. Clickbait refers to stories deliberately designed to get more website visitors and increase advertising revenue for the website owners – often at the expense of truth and accuracy.
This refers to false or distorted stories written to mislead audiences and promote a political agenda or biased perspective.
Sometimes, journalists don’t have time to check all their facts before publishing, leading to genuine mistakes becoming fake news. However, trusted new sources will correct errors in their stories and be transparent with readers when they’ve got things wrong.
Sometimes a story may be broadly true, but a sensationalist or misleading headline is used to entice readers to click on it. This can lead to fake news – since usually only the headline and small snippets of the article are displayed on social media, where it can quickly spread.
This is when genuine news sources are impersonated with false, made-up stories to deceive or mislead audiences.
Some fake news is published for entertainment value. For example, satirical stories use humor, irony, or exaggeration to joke about the news or famous people. These stories don't attempt to mislead audiences because they aren't meant to be taken seriously. Notable examples of satirical websites include The Onion and The Daily Mash.
High-profile politicians have been known to dismiss stories they disagree with – which may be factual and verified – as “fake news”. Because the term “fake news” is expansive and means different things to different people, it can be contested. In 2018, the British Government banned the term from official papers or documents, claiming it was too poorly defined to be meaningful. Instead, it prefers to use the terms ""misinformation"" and ""disinformation"" when describing false stories:
Fake news is often spread through fake news websites, which, in an attempt to gain credibility, often emulate authentic news sources. According to research, social media enables false claims to spread quickly – more quickly, in fact, than real news. Fake news spreads rapidly because it’s typically designed to grab attention and appeal to emotions – which is why it often features outlandish claims or stories which provoke anger or fear.
Social media feeds often prioritize content based on engagement metrics – that is, how often it’s shared and liked – rather than how accurate or well-researched it is. This approach can allow clickbait, hyperbole, and misinformation to spread widely. Social media companies are seen as platforms rather than publishers, which means they don’t have the same legal liabilities as traditional media outlets – although this may change as the political and legal landscape evolves.
Social media bots can spread fake news since they mass produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of their sources. Bots can create fake accounts online, which then gain followers, recognition, and authority – some of which are programmed to spread misinformation.
Trolls – internet users who deliberately try to start arguments or upset people – also play a part in spreading fake news. Sometimes they can be paid to do so for political reasons. The terms “troll farm” or “troll factory” are sometimes used in this context to refer to institutionalized groups of trolls who attempt to interfere in political decision-making.
Fake news sometimes involves the use of Deepfakes. These are fake videos created using digital software, machine learning, and face-swapping. Images are combined to create new footage which shows events or actions that never actually took place. The results can be very convincing and difficult to identify as false.
Coronavirus fake news
The Covid-19 pandemic provided fertile ground for false information online, with numerous examples of fake news throughout the crisis. A persistent example of fake news in social media was the claim that 5G technology was linked to the spread of the virus – supposedly because 5G suppressed the immune system while the virus communicated through radio waves. These claims were not true and were repeatedly debunked by official sources but were still shared extensively.
US presidential election in 2016
Fake news and misinformation became a big issue during the US election in 2016, with false and misleading claims across the political spectrum. One analysis suggested that a large proportion of fake news generated in the election was created by teenagers in Macedonia, who found the more hyper-partisan stories they created, the more people clicked through and shared, and the more money they made as a result.
Boston Marathon bombing
In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, false claims that the bombing was an elaborate ruse plotted by the US government circulated online. In the wake of many terrorist events across the world, conspiracy theories are often rife. The notion that they are ""false flag"" operations – i.e., carried out by the state or a secret cabal to pin the blame on others or provide cover for other activities – is a common trope.
Kim Jong-un – the sexiest man alive?
In 2012, satirical website The Onion ran an article claiming that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un had been voted the sexiest man alive, declaring that ""the Pyongyang-bred heartthrob is every woman's dream come true."" In an example of how satire can sometimes be misunderstood across cultures, publications in China – including the online version of China's Communist Party newspaper – reported the claim as though it were true.
People often make important decisions – for example, how to vote in an election or what medical treatment to follow when they’re ill – based on what they read in the news. That’s why trusted news is so important. The dangers of fake news include:
You may be wondering how to identify fake news on Facebook and other social media sites? As a student, how to avoid fake news? Or how to avoid accidentally sharing misinformation online? Here are ten tips to identify misinformation, recognize fake news websites, and think before you share:
1. Check the source:
Check the web address for the page you're looking at. Sometimes, fake news sites may have spelling errors in the URL or use less conventional domain extensions such as "".infonet"" or "".offer"". If you are unfamiliar with the site, look in the About Us section.
2. Check the author:
Research them to see if they are credible – for example, are they real, do they have a good reputation, are they writing about their specific area of expertise, and do they have a particular agenda? Consider what the writer’s motivation might be.
3. Check other sources:
Are other reputable news or media outlets reporting on the story? Are credible sources cited within the story? Professional global news agencies have editorial guidelines and extensive resources for fact-checking, so if they are also reporting the story, that’s a good sign.
4. Maintain a critical mindset:
A lot of fake news is cleverly written to provoke strong emotional reactions such as fear or anger. Maintain a critical mindset by asking yourself – why has this story been written? Is it promoting a particular cause or agenda? Is it trying to make me click through to another website?
5. Check the facts:
Credible news stories will include plenty of facts – data, statistics, quotes from experts, and so on. If these are missing, question why. Reports with false information often contain incorrect dates or altered timelines, so it’s a good idea to check when the article was published. Is it a current or old news story?
6. Check the comments:
Even if the article or video is legitimate, the comments below may not be. Often links or comments posted in response to content can be autogenerated by bots or people hired to put our misleading or confusing information.
7. Check your own biases:
We all have biases – could these be influencing the way you respond to the article? Social media can create echo chambers by suggesting stories that match your existing browsing habits, interests, and opinions. The more we read from diverse sources and perspectives, the more likely it is that we can draw accurate conclusions.
8. Check whether it’s a joke:
Satirical websites are popular, and sometimes it is not always clear whether a story is just a joke or parody. Check the website to see if it’s known for satire or creating funny stories.
9. Check images are authentic:
Images you see on social media could have been edited or manipulated. Possible signs include warping – where straight lines in the background now appear wavy – as well as strange shadows, jagged edges, or skin tone that looks too perfect. Bear in mind, too, that an image may be accurate but simply used in a misleading context. You can use tools such as Google’s Reverse Image Search to check where an image originates from and whether it has been altered.
10. Use a fact-checking site:
Some of the best known include:
Fake news relies on believers reposting, retweeting, or otherwise sharing false information. If you're not sure whether an article is authentic or not, pause and think before you share. To help stay safe online, use an antivirus solution like Kaspersky Total Security, which protects you from hackers, viruses, malware, and other online threats.

Deliberately inaccurate stories – that is, the people publishing them know them to be false but publish them anyway. This might be to manipulate public opinion or to drive traffic to a specific website.
Stories that contain elements of truth but are broadly inaccurate. This might be because the writer hasn’t checked all their facts or has exaggerated certain aspects to make a particular point.
Disinformation– fake or misleading stories created and shared deliberately, often by a writer who might have a financial or political motive to do so.
Misinformation – this also means fake or misleading stories, but in this case, the stories may not have been deliberately created or shared with the intention to mislead.
When people can’t distinguish between real and fake news, it creates confusion and misunderstanding about important social and political issues. When people have a generalized sense of ""you can't believe anything you read,"" it undermines overall trust in legitimate news sources.
Fake and misleading stories relating to medical treatments or major diseases – such as cancer or Covid-19 – could lead to individuals making misinformed decisions about their health.
A lot of fake news is designed to stir up and intensify social conflict. When different sides of an argument have their own ‘facts’, it leads to greater polarization within societies and can affect electoral outcomes.
Universities and colleges expect students to use quality sources of information for assignments. Students who use sources with false or misleading information could receive lower grades.

Get to know Figma's interface by designing a button.
Figma is a collaborative interface design tool that’s taken the design world by storm. Unlike Sketch or Adobe Illustrator, which are standalone applications, Figma can be run entirely from a web browser and, therefore, works not only on Macs but also on PCs running Windows or Linux, and even on Chromebooks. It's also free to use!
Another big advantage of Figma is that it allows real-time collaboration on the same file. When using conventional “offline” apps like Sketch and Illustrator, if designers want to share their work, they typically have to export it to an image file and then send it via email or instant message.
In Figma, instead of exporting static images, we can simply share a link to the Figma file for clients and colleagues to open in their browsers. This in itself saves significant time and can streamline a designer’s workflow. But more importantly, it means that clients and colleagues can interact more richly with the work and review the latest version of the file.
This course aims to introduce all of the key functions in Figma. We’ll achieve that by building a set of app screens together. We’ll also use Figma’s prototyping functionality to link the screens together, meaning you can experience how the screens will behave like they would if this were a functional app ready for people to download and use. You’ll be able to share your prototypes with friends, or develop your design further and add it to your portfolio!
Before we get started with today’s lesson, take a sec to work through our quick one-minute goal setting exercise. We want to make sure you’re getting the most out of this course... and that by the end of it you’ve mastered the basics of Figma and accomplished any personal learning goals!
Time to complete: 30 minutes
Getting started in Figma is as simple as going to www.figma.com, clicking “Get started”, entering your details, and completing a quick verification activity. Once you’ve done that, Figma will guide you to a screen with a few more onboarding questions before throwing you right into a project file with some examples of what you can create using Figma .
The look and feel of the Figma interface is quite minimal, but it belies a set of powerful features. Here’s an explanation of the interface’s main areas (labeled above):
Unlike regular desktop design apps, Figma’s menu can be found by clicking the Figma logo in the top-left of the screen. Take a minute to browse around this dropdown and see what’s there! Here, you can also search for specific commands you need. Click on the magnifying glass where it says “Quick actions…” and type in “rectangle” and you’ll quickly find the Rectangle Tool, complete with a handy reminder of its keyboard shortcut (it’s [[R]], by the way).
Here you can quickly access the tools you’re likely to use most often: move, frame, shapes, pen, text, etc. (We’ll cover these tools in the next couple of days!)
This area shows extra options for whatever object you have selected on your canvas. When no object is selected (as shown above), Figma displays the file name.
The right side of the toolbar is where you can find the file sharing functions and see who else is viewing your file in real-time. You’ll also find view and zoom options.
Also known simply as the “left sidebar,” this is where every element in the file is listed and organized into Pages, Frames and Groups.
‍This is where you’ll create all of your designs!
The properties panel offers contextual information and settings for whatever object is selected. In the image above, we’re seeing options for the Canvas itself. By default, you’re viewing the Design tab, but there is also a separate tab for setting up a Prototype —we’ll cover this later in the week.
Now that you’ve found your way around, let’s start making stuff! Let’s start a new project by clicking the Menu button (Figma’s logo) in the top left corner and then selecting File and “New design file.” Doing this should automatically create a new file with an empty canvas in a new tab on your browser.
In Figma, a Frame is essentially a container for other elements. If you’ve used Sketch or Adobe Illustrator before, it functions in the same way as an Artboard. Press [[F]] to select the Frame Tool. Alternatively, you can click the Frame tool icon in the toolbar at the top of the window. Equally, if you’re used to Sketch, you can also hit [[A]] (for “Artboard”).
Note that we’ll often refer to keyboard shortcuts in these tutorials. It’s worth getting in the habit of using these shortcuts because they’ll significantly speed up your workflow further down the line. In the short videos through this course, you’ll see the keystrokes we use on Mac computers.
There are a couple of ways of creating a Frame. We can either click and drag in the canvas area, or we can select a pre-set Frame size from the Properties panel on the right hand side of the window. We chose the iPhone SE template. Try both ways now!
You’ll probably find yourself wanting to zoom in and out quite a bit in Figma, particularly once we start working with multiple Frames. The standard zoom commands are accessed with [[⌘]][[+]] and [[⌘]][[-]]. Try it now!
Those commands will just focus in on the center of your current view. But there are some other handy zoom commands available:
Select the Frame by clicking on its name, then try alternating these commands to switch between the selection and the whole canvas.
Finally, here’s an *extra* handy zoom tip to move between Frames without having to zoom in and out the whole time:
Another useful tool, particularly when you’re zoomed in close or working on a large file, is the Hand tool. Try pressing and holding the [[Spacebar]] on your keyboard and you’ll see a hand icon pop up. Click and drag to move the whole canvas around. If you’re working with a Mac trackpad, you can do the same by dragging on the trackpad with two fingers.
Next, let’s create some text. Press [[T]] to select the Text tool, and click anywhere within your iPhone SE frame to create a Text layer. This is going to be part of a button design, so let’s type “Sign In”. Hit [[Escape]] to exit the Text tool.
Press [[R]] to select the Rectangle tool. Drag a button-shaped rectangle around the text you just created.
Currently, the text is hidden underneath the rectangle. To fix this, we need to use Figma’s “Arrange” commands. Head over to the Layers panel on the left of the window. Select the “Sign In” text layer, then right-click (PC/Mac) or ctrl-click (Mac) to bring up a list of options. Click “Bring to front”, and the text will now be placed on top of the rectangle.
You can also access Arrange tools using keyboard shortcuts:
Mac:
PC:
This being a button, we want the text and rectangle shapes to be centered relative to one another. Figma has a set of “Align” commands that allow us to do this. Make sure that the Move tool is selected by pressing [[Escape]], or [[V]], and then drag a “marquee” (a rectangular selection) around the text and the rectangle.
We can access the Align commands in the Properties (the interface area to the right of the window). Click “Align Horizontal Centers” and “Align Vertical Centers” to get the two objects nicely lined up.
Select the rectangle shape you just created. In the Properties panel, there is a setting called “Corner Radius”, which allows us to make the corners of any shape rounded. Here, type in the number of pixels you want each corner to be rounded by.
To max out the corners and create semi-circles at each end of the rectangle, just enter a number larger than half the object height. (We set ours to 32 so that we’re covered in case we want to make the button a bit bigger later on—but try out some different numbers and see what happens!)
The color settings can also be found in the Properties panel. We often want to attract people’s attention with buttons—so select the rectangle, and pick a bright color! We’ve gone with a bright yellow by typing in a hex code (#EEEE33)—but you can also click to open the color palette, and pick a color that way.

UPDATED Nov. 3, 2024, at 12:07 PM

We adjust polls for house effects, mode, partisanship, voter likelihood and third parties and weight them based on their firm’s 538 pollster rating and how often it polls.
LAST UPDATED Nov. 1
Now that we are in the closing days of the 2024 presidential race, pollsters have started releasing their final readings of the campaign. They have mostly been a mixed bag. On Friday, Marist College released their highly-anticipated final polls across the Midwestern states, finding Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of former President Donald Trump by 3 points in Michigan, 2 points in Pennsylvania and 2 points in Wisconsin. That would be good news for Harris if those were the only polls released this week, but they weren’t: An Echelon Insights survey found Trump up 5 points in the Keystone State, and CNN/SSRS has the former president up by 1 in Georgia. In aggregate, this has been enough to push our model modestly back in Harris’s direction. Currently, our forecast gives Trump a XXX out of 100 chance of winning the election, and gives Harris a XXX out of 100 chance.
Still, the closeness of the race bears repeating what has become something of a mantra here at 538 recently: A close race in the polls does not necessarily mean the outcome will be close. All seven swing states are still within a normal polling error of going to the candidate who is currently “losing”in each. While the polls have identified a close race, our model shows what you should expect if those polls are off.
538’s forecast is based on a combination of polls and campaign “fundamentals,” such as economic conditions, state partisanship and incumbency. It’s not meant to “call” a winner, but rather to give you a sense of how likely each candidate is to win. Check out our methodology to learn exactly how we calculate these probabilities.
—G. Elliott Morris
The forecast updates at least once a day and whenever we get new data. Uncertainty will decrease as we get closer to Election Day.
We forecast the popular vote only for candidates polling at 5 percent or higher nationally, polling at 10 percent or higher in at least one state or who are on the ballot in almost every state. Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s withdrawal, only Harris and Trump meet these criteria, so we are effectively forecasting the two-way popular vote between Democrats and Republicans.
Number of electoral votes and the probability of a Democratic or Republican win in each state. Outlined states are most likely to give the winner their 270th Electoral College vote.
Use the table below to sort states by name, forecasted margin of victory or two different metrics of how much influence they have over the outcome.
A state’s tipping-point chance is the probability it will give the Electoral College winner their 270th electoral vote. The Voter Power Index (VPI) is a relative measure of how likely an individual voter in that state is to determine the outcome of the election.

Our “snake” chart orders the states by forecasted margin of victory. Scroll to the left or right to see uncompetitive states; more contested states are in the middle. Bigger segments mean more Electoral College votes.
This graph shows the national popular vote margin and Electoral College margin in every model simulation. It shows you how often a candidate wins the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.
Our forecast is based on a combination of the polls and various economic and political variables we call the “fundamentals.” This chart shows how we get from the polls today to a forecast for Election Day.

Paragraphs:
With just two days left until Election Day, Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris are putting the bows on their presidential campaigns, wrapping up arguments in must-win states before their final test: Tuesday, Nov. 5.
The former president has rallies scheduled in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia, while the vice president has planned multiple stops in Michigan.
Keep up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage live from the campaign trail.
Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told USA TODAY Sunday that he believes Donald Trump has the “advantage” in the presidential race as it comes to a conclusion, but said the former president could be doing more to close the deal.
Sign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.
“You could’ve been more uniting, you know, if you put the Nikki Haleys, others, in there,” McCarthy said. “You’re running a general election, not a primary.”
Trump’s former United Nations Ambassador, Haley ran against the former president in the GOP primary and drew support from moderate Republicans, a group Kamala Harris has courted with endorsements from Republicans such as former Rep. Liz Cheney. Haley endorsed Trump and spoke at the Republican National Convention, but hasn’t been on the campaign trail with him.
“To me it’s all about addition not subtraction,” McCarthy said. “So where am I weak? I bring Nikki Haley in.”
Yet McCarthy also believes Trump has “reached out” beyond his base by incorporating Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a former Democrat, into his campaign. Kennedy, who Trump has promised to give a big role on health issues in a future administration, has been campaigning heavily for the former president in the closing stretch. Kennedy is an anti-vaccine advocate whose public comments on health care have drawn widespread backlash.
– Zac Anderson
After attending a Sunday morning church service, Kamala Harris grabbed lunch at a chicken and waffles restaurant in Detroit.
The crowd crammed inside Kuzzo’s Chicken and Waffles erupted into cheers when Harris entered the restaurant, which is owned by former Detroit Lions cornerback Ron Bartell. The vice president worked the room for several minutes, shaking hands with two women who work at the eatery and posing for photos and selfies with other patrons.
Spotted in the crowd: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan.
No word on what the VP picked up for lunch.
–Michael Collins
Oprah Winfrey and Lady Gaga will join Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff Monday night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the Democratic nominee makes her closing arguments to voters, according to her campaign.
Winfrey and Gaga’s appearances will wrap up a star-studded lineup of back-to-back Harris-Walz events across all seven battleground states, all featuring a range of celebrity appearances and musical performances.
Harris will hold two in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, starting off in Pittsburgh where D-Nice, Katy Perry and Andra Day are slated to perform and ending in Philadelphia. Winfrey and Gaga will be joined on stage by DJ Cassidy, Fat Joe, Freeway, Just Blaze, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ricky Martin, The Roots, Jazmine Sullivan and Adam Blackstone.
The Pennsylvania rallies are part of a series of get-out-the-vote events simultaneously taking place in other critical swing states of North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan. Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will appear alongside his wife, Gwen Walz, at an early evening event in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and wrap up in Detroit, Michigan, with performances by the Detroit Youth Choir, Jon Bon Jovi, The War and Treaty.

With just two days until the election, Kamala Harris on Sunday made a pitch to Arab Americans who are on the fence about supporting her over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.
Asked by a reporter in Detroit what her closing argument would be to Arab Americans, Harris repeated what she has said previously about the war in the Gaza Strip. The number of “innocent Palestinians” killed is “unconscionable,” she said.
“We need to end the war, and we need to get the hostages out, and as president of the United States, I will do everything in my power to achieve that end,” Harris said.
Harris also repeated her call for a two-state solution.

The line snaked down the halls Sunday afternoon for the Harris/Walz rally at a hotel in Atlanta, where Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and second gentleman Doug Emhoff were slated to speak. Some people wore T-shirts that read, “We’re not going back’’ and “Republicans for Harris.” Renee Cobbs, 70, of Powder Springs, Georgia was among the first to get into the ballroom.
“I’m celebrating already,’’ Cobbs said as she pinned a Harris button on her jean jacket. “I’m optimistic not only about Georgia, but also the other battleground states.’’
It was Cobbs’ second Harris/Walz rally. She went to hear the vice president at a recent rally in Decatur, Georgia. By Friday, the last day for early voting, more than 4 million people had voted in Georgia, according to the Georgia Secretary of State’s office.
Cobbs said she worries Trump is too negative and pointed to what she called his ramped up rhetoric, which she said has only gotten worse since Harris took the top of the ticket. “Kamala is one of the best things for the country and the world at this point,’’ said Cobbs.

Kamala Harris has cast her vote for president – by mail.
Harris, who served as a U.S. senator from California before becoming vice president, told reporters traveling with her on Sunday that she has filled out her ballot and that it is in the mail.
“My ballot is on its way to California, and I'm going to trust the system that it will arrive there,” she said.
Harris declined to say how she voted on a California ballot measure that would increase penalties for some theft- and drug-related crimes.
“I am not going to talk about the vote on that, because, honestly, it's the Sunday before the election, and I don't intend to create an endorsement one way or another around it,” she said.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Saturday that Donald Trump would seek to remove fluoride from public water sources as one of his first presidential actions if he is reelected, falsely suggesting that the compound is dangerous.
The American Dental Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed water fluoridation, citing studies that show fluoride in community water systems can prevents at least 25 percent of tooth decay in children and adults.
When reached for comment about Kennedy's remarks, Trump campaign Senior Adviser Danielle Alvarez did not directly address Kennedy's assertion, saying that Trump has ""received a variety of policy ideas"" but ""is focused on Tuesday’s election.""
But in a phone call with Trump on Sunday morning, NBC News reporter Dasha Burns said the former president appeared open to Kennedy's plans. The former president reportedly said ""Well, I haven't talked to him about it yet, but it sounds okay to me. You know it's possible,"" when asked about Kennedy's suggestion to remove fluoride from public water.

Donald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that he ""shouldn't have left"" the White House as he touted his accomplishments during office.
As Trump addressed his handling of the southern border and the nation's economy, he told the crowd, ""we had the safest border in the history of our country the day that I left,” adding ""I shouldn't have left, I mean honestly.""
Trump has long falsely said that fraud impacted the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The former president launched a legal battle in states across the country after the election, but his claims of fraud were all rejected by courts.

As voters look to polls and political analysts for insight into who might win the presidency on Tuesday, a feud between two of the nation’s leading election prognosticators, Allan Lichtman and Nate Silver, will soon be put to the test.
Lichtman, an American University professor who has correctly predicted nine out of 10 of the last presidential elections, has forecasted a win for Vice President Kamala Harris.
Silver, the statistician and pollster who founded FiveThirtyEight, wrote recently in the New York Times that the race is a virtual tie, but his “gut” tells him former President Donald Trump will likely prevail.

Visiting Arizona just days before Election Day, JD Vance revved up a crowd in Scottsdale by arguing that Kamala Harris has prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens.
Vance, a senator from Ohio and the Republican nominee for vice president, ticked through a list of economic woes facing Americans and, using at times exaggerated or unclear claims, tied each problem to President Joe Biden and Harris' record on illegal immigration.
“Compassion, for the American president, has to start with the American people, and the people who have the legal right to be here,” Vance told hundreds of supporters at Dillon Precision, a guns and ammunition storefront in Scottsdale.

Kamala Harris followed her guest appearance on Saturday Night Live by stopping by a Sunday morning church service in Detroit.
Harris told congregants of the Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ that Tuesday’s election will give Americans a chance to decide whether they want to live in a country of “chaos, fear and hate” or “freedom, justice and compassion.”
Americans should answer that question, she said, “not just with our faith, but with our feet as we walk to the polls.”
The country will be tested over the next two days and the road won’t be easy, Harris said. But in times of uncertainty, she concluded by citing Psalm 30:5, “we are reminded weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.”
“Morning is on its way,” she said.

It is not clear exactly when the election results will be announced, as the timing depends on a variety of factors. Each state handles its elections differently, ranging from weeks-long early voting to strict voter ID laws.
But you can anticipate delays.
Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., was asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" about the major gender gap among supporters that has emerged between Harris and Trump.
For example, a USA TODAY/Suffolk poll of Pennsylvania voters found Trump is up by 20 points among men in the commonwealth, 57% to 37%, while Harris has an 18% hold on women over Trump, 57% to 39%. That’s compared to Trump’s 16-point advantage among men nationally and Harris 17-point advantage among women.
Stefanik denied concerns about Trump’s performance among women, turning the conversation to Harris’ numbers with male voters, telling host Shannon Bream “Trump is doing better among women than Kamala Harris is doing among men.”
She also said that inflation and concerns about the southern border were reasons that women would vote for Trump, claiming American women were economically better of under Trump. “It was the highest number of women ever in the workforce, the largest wage and salary increase for working women ever, childcare was affordable,” Stefanik said.
It was not immediately clear what metric Stefanik was referencing. Data from the US Department of Labor shows that women’s labor force participation peaked in 1999.

Talking about the protective glass surrounding him, Donald Trump said at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday that a potential assassin would need to shoot through the news media to hit him. “I don’t mind that,” he said.
“I have a piece of glass over here. And I don't have a piece of glass there. And I have this piece of glass here. But all we really have over here is the fake news,” right?” Trump said to laughs from the crowd.
“And to get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that,” he said.

The former president usually loves to talk about polls, but on Sunday he criticized a surprising new poll out of the Midwest.
""The polls are just as corrupt as some of the writers back there,"" Trump said during an airport rally near Lancaster, Pennsylvania., the start of a fly-around that will take him to North Carolina and Georgia on Sunday.
Trump specifically cited The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released on Saturday that shows him now trailing Harris in the Hawkeye State. But he also knocked other surveys released ahead of Election Day.
""We've got all this crap going on, with the press and with the fake stuff,"" Trump said. ""And fake polls.""
– David Jackson
Donald Trump at rally in Lititz, Pa. on Sunday morning repeated arguments that elections should only last one day and should be conducted on paper ballots, rather than on voting machines. He also aired concerns that election offices were “extending hours and stuff.”
“Whoever heard of this stuff?” Trump said.
A judge in Pennsylvania last week extended the deadline for Bucks County voters to request a mail-in ballot after Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging that long lines prevented some supporters from being able to get their ballot. The order extended the deadline from Wednesday, Oct. 30 to Friday, Nov. 1.
In Indiana, election officials in one county have proposed adding additional early morning voting hours to stem long voting lines.

Top Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski is dismissing a poll out of Iowa that shows the former president trailing Kamala Harris in the red state.
The Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll has 47% of likely voters backing Harris, compared to Trump’s 44%. Lewandowski said the poll is “a complete outlier that has no credibility” and noted that the same poll had Trump and President Joe Biden tied in the state late in the 2020 race.
Trump won Iowa by eight percentage points in 2020. Lewandowski noted that Harris hasn’t been campaigning in Iowa in pushing back against the idea that the state is in play.
It’s a bad sign for the Trump campaign if Harris is doing well in Iowa, one that raises questions about the former president’s prospects in other states with large numbers of older white voters. The Des Moines Register/Mediacom survey shows Harris winning females voters by 20 percentage points. She also has a big lead with senior voters and is beating Trump with Iowa independents.

Sen. John Fetterman strongly condemned Donald Trump and Republicans rhetoric about transgender rights during an interview on CNN Sunday, saying “it doesn't make you tough. It doesn't make you a man to pick on trans or gay kids.”
Fetterman was asked by anchor Dana Bash about whether Trump campaign ads that suggest Kamala Harris is “for they/them” are resonating in the pivotal swing state.
“If your political capital, you know, comes from picking on trans kids or gay kids or anything like that, that you're just bankrupt throughout all of this,” Fetterman said. “My version of being is, it's like, ‘Hey, I like ribeye, I like Motorhead, and I'm never going to pick on trans kids and gay kids.”
Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, have made anti-trans attacks a major part of their closing message to voters in the 2024 election, arguing

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a campaign surrogate for Donald Trump who was once floated as a possible running mate, is brushing off new polling that suggests a Democratic victory in a long-red state.
A Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
In an interview with Kristen Welker on Sunday’s “Meet the Press,” Burgum placed little stock with the surprise poll figures, pointing to a competing Saturday poll from Emerson College putting Trump in a 10-point lead over Harris in the state.
“If you take the average of those last two polls, I think Trump's still going to confidently win Iowa,” Burgum said on the NBC talk show Sunday. “I would be surprised, completely shocked, that [Harris win] comes anywhere close to being the fact that Iowa.”
The Republican governor remained optimistic of his party’s candidate, pointing to his recent campaign trail visits in several key battleground states: ""It’s a very tight race that is going to be decided on Tuesday, but the momentum in the last week that I felt on the ground... is that the energy from all demographics is very, very positive.”
– Kathryn Palmer
Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to criticize a new Iowa poll that shows him trailing Kamala Harris in the Midwestern state.
""No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump,"" he said Sunday on his Truth Social account. ""In fact, it’s not even close!""
Even so, a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday shows Harris leading Trump 47% to 44% among likely voters.
A loss in Iowa would be major for Trump, who campaigns today in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia.

Indiana Jones is standing with Kamala Harris.
Actor Harrison Ford, who in a series of films played the adventurous archaeologist with a phobia of snakes, has released a video in which he endorses the Democratic presidential nominee and expresses a fear of something else: a second Donald Trump presidency.
In the video, a gruff-voiced Ford cites the dozens of former members of the Trump administration who are sounding the alarm about the Republican nominee and telling voters “for God’s sake, don’t do this again.” Harris, he said, will protect Americans’ rights to degree with her on policy or ideas “and then, as we have done for centuries, we'll debate them, we'll work on them together, and we'll move forward.”
Ford concludes by saying he has one vote, “same as anyone else,” and that he’s going to use it by moving forward and voting for Harris.

Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., appearing Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" was asked about President Joe Biden's comment last week in which he appeared to call Trump's supporters ""garbage.""
The president has since said he was only referring to the racist rhetoric at Donald Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. But Warnock on Sunday called for all Americans to take a closer look at the way they talk politics.
""As the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served, I think that we all need to elevate the character and the tone of our political discourse,"" Warnock said, adding that he believes ""That's what Kamala Harris is doing.""

Could red-state Iowa be shifting back to purple as a presidential swing state?
The new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll released Saturday night shows Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Donald Trump by 3 percentage points in the state, 47% to 44% – a result that suggests Iowa is in play with Election Day fast approaching.
Yet neither campaign has treated Iowa and its six Electoral College delegates as up for grabs. Neither Harris nor Trump has campaigned in Iowa since the presidential primaries, and neither campaign has established a ground presence in the state, according to Des Moines Register chief politics reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel.
– Des Moines Register staff
The 2024 race for the White House is set to be neck-and-neck until Election Day. In Real Clear Politics' average of national polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.1 percentage points, well within the margin of error for each of the surveys included.
It's also razor-close in swing states across the country. For example, Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Real Clear Politics' average of Wisconsin polls.

Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission suggested in a social media post on Sunday that Kamala Harris’ appearance on “Saturday Night Live” may have broke the FCC’s Equal Time Rule.
Carr called Harris’ spot on the comedy show a “clear and blatant effort to evade,” the commissions rule, unless NBC offered Donald Trump a similar opportunity. The Equal Time Rule stipulates that radio and TV broadcasters give political candidates similar air time.
“With only days before the election, NBC appears to have structured this appearance in a way that evades these requirements,” Carr said in his post on X, formerly Twitter.
Carr, who was appointed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, is among five commissioners on the FCC. The other commissioners have not yet publicly weighed in on the matter. It's also not clear what conversations, if any, NBC and the Trump campaign have conducted.

Every artist needs an artboard, brush, palette, paint, and a vision to create the beautiful art we all love.
…or, in some cases, have no choice but to love.

Like artists, designers also require specific tools to create engaging design systems people can interact with.
One that you’ve probably heard of is Figma – a cloud-based design tool.
Let’s cut to the chase!
To get started on Figma, you need to have an account. So, let’s open one together.
First, go to www.figma.com and click the Get Started button at the top right corner to sign up. If you have an account with them already, click the Log in button instead.

Since this is a tutorial, we’ll go with the sign-up option. For that, Figma gives you two choices.

Click the Continue with Google button or enter your email and preferred password. You’ll also be asked to input your name, specify the kind of work you do, and how you intend to use Figma.
Then, click the Create account button. You’ll be sent a verification email almost immediately. Open the message and tap Verify email, and you’re all set.
Now, you should have access to a dashboard that looks like this:

Creating new projects
To create projects in Figma, you must be part of a team. If you already are, just join them and open their file browser. But if you don’t, click the Create new team button on the left side of the page and enter a team name. Then invite collaborators you’d like to work with you on the project.

After you’ve created a team, you’ll be taken to the team’s page. From there, you can create a new project.
So let’s do that!
Click on the New project button on the top right side of your team’s file page. Enter a name for the project if you’re on Figma’s Pro plan or select the Team project box to proceed if you’re on the free plan.

Voila! You’ve created a new project.
You can only create one project and three designs with the Free plan. But with the Pro plan, you can access unlimited projects and designs.
Adding a design file
Design files house the design you want to work on, and they can be added to the project’s environment.

Just tap the New design file button, and you’ll be redirected to a new page that shows the Figma file like this. 👇

You can give your design file a name when you first create it. The default name is ‘Untitled,’ but you can tap on it to change it, so it’s more descriptive.
Explore Figma templates
Figma has a database of templates you can customize for your UX designs. To access them, head back to the project folder and select See all. It’s just under the New Design button you clicked on earlier.

Now that your Figma account is set up let’s start creating new frames for your design.
Frames are like boards on Figma. They represent the interface end users of the design will interact with. You can select different frames on Figma in which to place your design.
To create new frames, open the design file and click the Frame tool in the top left-hand corner. Having trouble finding it? Look for the button that looks like a hashtag. You can also create new frames by pressing the letter F on your keyboard.

Choosing a frame size
Once you’ve selected the frame tool, go to the left side of the page. Pick a frame from the selections available, and it’ll appear on the canvas. Available frame sizes include most iPhones and Androids.
For this tutorial, let’s select the Surface Pro 8 frame:

If you need a frame different from the ones available, you can draw your own by clicking and dragging the mouse.
Editing a frame’s properties
After selecting a frame, you’ll see a panel under Design on the right side of the page. There you can assign different properties to the frame as you see fit.
For example, you can change the frame size by typing in your desired pixel size in the X, Y, W, and H columns.
Other things you can do include filling the frame with color using Fill, adding effects by clicking Effects, and more.
Using layers
On the left side of the screen is the Layers panel. Each time you add a new element or frame, a new layer is added. You can rearrange them by dragging and dropping them.
You can also group layers to have a more organized file if you want to move them across different frames. To group layers, select all the elements. Press Ctrl+G if you’re a Windows user or CMD+G on a Mac.
Vector shapes
If you want to use basic shapes (rectangle, circle, etc.), pick the square sign from the top of the page.
For more complex shapes, icons, logos, or buttons, select the pen icon from the top menu or press P on your keyboard.

With it, you can click anywhere on the frame to create the kind of shape you have in mind. Then, press Enter when you’re done.
If you want to modify the vector shape when designing, you can do so via the Properties menu on the right-hand side of the page.
What’s a design without pictures? Here’s how you add them on Figma!
There are different ways to insert images into your frame on Figma. The most popular and simplest way is to drag and drop them into your work area.
You can also click the Shape menu at the top of the page and select Place image/video.

When you click Open, a dialogue box will open, where you can select the images you want to use. Then, click OK to insert the pictures.
Alternatively, press CMD+Shift+K or Ctrl+Shift+K, to open the dialogue box.
If the image you want to use is from another place on Figma, select the image and press CMD+C or Ctrl+C. Head over to the frame you want to use and press CMD+V or Ctrl+V.
But what if you want to insert the image into a different shape or frame?
To do that, click on the frame. Select Fill from the Properties menu on the right side of the work area if you want to add color.
You’ll see a drop-down menu at the top-left of the color wheel: click it and select Image or Videos.

To choose an image, hover your cursor on the smaller window with black and white colors and click Choose Image.

A dialogue box will pop up so you can pick the images you want. Click Open to insert them into the shape or frame.
If you want, you can edit the picture with the different parameters shown in the small window.
To insert objects, click the square shape icon from the top menu to draw polygons, stars, arrows, lines, rectangles, and ellipses.

Select any shape, click on the frame, and drag it to your preferred size. For a shape with equal proportions, press down the shift key while you draw.
Adding text on Figma is pretty straightforward too.
Just click the T sign and tap on where you want the text on the frame to draw a text box. Then, start typing.
To edit the text, click the text layer and double-click on the text to edit. You can also edit it from the Properties menu. There, you’ll be able to change the text’s color, font, and even edit the words in the content section.
Now, if you’re working on multiple design projects using Figma, wouldn’t it be great to have saved styles that you could simply add to each project?
To learn how to save styles, keep reading!
By saving your styles, you can avoid having to redo the same design process over and over again.

For example, if you want the text headings of your design to have the same font, color, and size, you can create a style and save it as a reusable H2 style.
Then, apply that style to the corresponding headings.
Here’s how to create a text style:
To use the style, select the text you want formatted and click on the style icon to select it.
Text isn’t the only style you can save. Aside from text, you can also save colors, grids, and even effects.
As we saw earlier, saved styles can help you reuse colors or effects in future projects. To do that, you’ll need to:
You can follow the same steps when adding the text style to text whenever you need to reuse the saved templates.
There’s just one tiny drawback with saving a style; it’ll only be available on the file you’re working on.
So, what if you wanna use the styles on other project files? You’ll have to publish it to your team library. Here’s how:

That’s about it for saving styles. This should help you save time when brainstorming, wireframing, or designing.
To further simplify this process, you might want to consider adding reusable components to your design workflow.
Don’t worry, we’ll unpack what it means and how to add them in the next section.
Components are collections of UI elements, objects, or layers that you can repeatedly use across your design. They make it easy to maintain a consistent design to update or scale your work without stress.
Let’s assume you’re working on web design and want the logo and name of the brand to appear across the site.
Those are different elements that you can reuse. You could add both to a component and title it ‘brand logo.’ Then, add it to other frames.
Follow these steps when adding components:
You’ll notice that both layers will be fused into a single layer with the new name: ‘Component 1.’ You can rename it by double-clicking on the name.
This refers to the use of iterations of the components in your design that are not in the initial component.
To create a component icon, click on the Assets panel, the tab next to the Layers menu on the left side of the page.
Select and drag the component’s name to the canvas, creating an instance. You can edit the component icon, which won’t reflect on the original.

Like styles, you can save components for other files or projects.
Click anywhere on the canvas and select the down arrow beside the file’s name at the top of the page.
From the drop-down menu, click Publish library and follow the on-screen instructions to publish the component to the team library.
This feature, however, is only available to Pro or Enterprise users.
Still, in simplifying your processes, there’s another thing you can do…
Auto layout is a function that lets you create a dynamic frame that expands or contracts when you change the content inside it.
This will help you avoid having to adjust the frame repeatedly. It also lets you see whether your design works in real life with a single click.
To begin, change layers to auto layouts:

As you change the content, the box automatically resizes.
Nested auto layouts
Figma also lets you nest auto layouts, meaning you can have a frame within a frame for a more attractive user interface or UI design.
To nest auto layouts, you should have multiple elements or objects you want to merge.
Select them, press shift+A, and you’ll have a nested auto layout.
It should include a parent frame and a child frame.
And that’s about it for auto layouts!
You know how you can take a car you plan on buying for a test drive?
Well, you can do the same for your interface design. But on Figma, it’s referred to as testing prototypes, which we unpack next.
Whether you’re designing a mobile app, landing page, or website, you can test the user experience of either project on Figma’s space in real-time. Testing will help you know what needs to be improved.
To start testing, head over to the Properties menu on the right side of the page. Click the Prototype tab at the top of the panel.
The first thing you’ll likely see is the option to select the device type you want to preview the design on.
If you already selected the device you were designing for when you created the frame, you won’t see that option.

To proceed, click the + sign beside Flow starting point.
It will place a Flow 1 text at the top left corner of the first frame to indicate that as the starting point of the design flow. If you don’t want the selected frame as the first point, right-click the frame’s name and pick Delete starting point.

After selecting the starting point, you must select a hotspot from the starting frame. A hotspot is an area or element users must click to be directed to the next page.
To pick a hotspot, hover over the desired element and see a blue circle by the edge.
When your mouse is directly on the circle, a plus sign will appear. Click and drag the hotspot (+) to connect it to the next screen. It should look like this:

After making the connection, you should see an Interaction details panel.
There you can choose an interaction type for the hotspot. For instance, select On tap if you want the user to tap the hotspot to go to the next page. You can also choose an animation from the menu to show the transition between both screens.
Now, you can make more connections by selecting a hotspot on the second screen that, when users tap it, will link back to the first screen.
When you’re done, you can preview the web or app design by clicking the Play button at the top right corner of the screen.
If you’re comfortable with the final designs, there’s only one step left: invite team members or other stakeholders to collaborate.
Sharing a project with your team, aka developer handoff, is easy on Figma. Just click the Share button at the top right corner of the page.

Then, enter the email of other users or collaborators you want to share it with.
A shortcut is just to copy the link and share it with stakeholders. If you go with this option, update the security setting to Anyone with the link.
***
And with that, we’ve come to the end of this tutorial.
Whew, that was a lot! But we’re confident that you’ve gained a lot from this guide.
Just one more thing, and we can call it a day.
So far, you’ve learned how to use Figma for designs, mockups, and as a prototyping tool.
What you need, in addition to that, is a more streamlined design process that can help you get clear contextual feedback on your visuals.
While Figma allows you to add comments, you can do much more with MarkUp.io.
More specifically, you can optimize reviews, implement feedback, and keep track of the comments as you resolve them.
There’ll also be less confusion for clients who probably won’t get the hang of the design tool you’re using. Feel free to claim a free 30-day trial with MarkUp.io to see for yourself.

Im overwhelmed by the amount of resources there are out there. Some says to learn the subject other to learn tool, some both, ahh so much chores, that i decided to learn the tool but now again there are tons of resources. docs, tutorial, project. am i doing wrong my learning through project? like without understanding spacing,color etc just copying pasting or trying my own idea to do that in figma then learn lets say for that project i required to use gradient so i searched all the way to learn then back to project repeat the process till my project is done.

Am i doing wrong by learning through this method. i feel like i am wasting time by first understanding tool one by one then at last building project for example what is frame and its propetries then at the time of building i dont really remember what i watched or read
Should i switch to my old method of learning through project? whether its fancy project that i know isnt appicable in real life till making cuz its seems interesting not caring much about perfect spacing and guidelines for now, what do you think?

Paragraphs:

Nate CohnChief political analyst
While the overall result of our final Times/Siena polls is largely unchanged since our previous wave of battleground polls, there were some notable shifts. Surprisingly, the longstanding gap between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt battlegrounds narrowed considerably. The overall effect of these swings is somewhat contradictory — Harris’s position in the Electoral College isn’t necessarily improved. Updated Nov. 3

While the overall result of our final Times/Siena polls is largely unchanged since our previous wave of battleground polls, there were some notable shifts. Surprisingly, the longstanding gap between the Rust Belt and Sun Belt battlegrounds narrowed considerably. The overall effect of these swings is somewhat contradictory — Harris’s position in the Electoral College isn’t necessarily improved. Updated Nov. 3
Both Trump and Harris have states they can probably count on to get at least 200 electoral votes, but they need to get to 270 to win. Let’s zoom in on seven key states in the middle where the vote was closest in 2020.
Harris 251
Trump 268
If the polls miss in Trump’s favor Trump could win if the polls are underestimating him even slightly. In 2016 and 2020, he outperformed the polls in the swing states, and he could do it again. Here’s one possibility.
Harris 226
Trump 312
If the polls miss in Harris’s favor Harris could easily prevail if the polls are underestimating her. For example, state polls underestimated Democrats in the 2022 midterms, and they could also miss in that direction this year. Here’s a possible scenario.
Harris 292
Trump 246
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Across the seven swing states that are likely to decide the outcome of this election, the polls are so remarkably close that neither candidate has a meaningful edge in this final stretch. But if the polls are off even by a small margin, it’s possible either candidate could sweep most or all of these states. You can explore all possible scenarios and see the potential paths to victory here. Updated Oct. 23
States are shown in order of the closest current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
We now have enough polls to generate an average in Iowa, after a new poll from the well-regarded pollster J. Ann Selzer. That poll finds Harris up three percentage points. Our average has Trump ahead by 2 percentage points, which puts it in line with the core battleground states. Updated Nov. 2
It’s normal for polls not to match the final results, sometimes by considerable amounts. The ranges in this chart represent the magnitude of each state’s biggest polling miss in recent elections, shown in relation to the current polling averages.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
In 2016 and 2020, the polls underestimated Trump. But in 2012 they underestimated the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, and in 2022 Democrats outperformed polling averages in several key midterm races. Past polling misses can give a sense of the magnitude by which current averages could be wrong, but they are not a guarantee of which way today’s polls may be off.
Every poll here influences the averages above. Polls from “select pollsters,” which meet certain criteria for reliability, count for more and are shown with a diamond. You can filter by state and toggle to show only select pollsters.
Ruth IgielnikStaff editor, polling
Polls by “select pollsters” are shown with a diamond. These pollsters have backgrounds that tend to mean they are more reliable. Also, polls that were conducted by or for partisan organizations are labeled, as they often release only results that are favorable to their cause.
Arrows to the left indicate polling gains for Harris; to the right, for Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Even as Trump has gained over the last few weeks, the battleground states remain extraordinarily tight. With the race so close, it wouldn’t take much of a polling error to yield a different outcome. The polls are never exactly right; if they err one way or another by a point or two, as usual, then either side could win by a decisive margin. Updated Oct. 31
This chart shows how the polling margin has changed over the course of the campaign, first for the Biden vs. Trump matchup, and now for Harris vs. Trump.
Nate CohnChief political analyst
Nationwide, Harris now has her smallest lead in our average since the Democratic convention. Most of the major national polls have showed a shift toward Trump since their prior surveys. The size of his gains shouldn’t be overstated — we’re talking about a point or so — but it has nonetheless been enough to make the race more or less truly tied. Whatever edge Harris might have had has vanished. Updated Oct. 23
About our polling averages
Our averages include polls collected by The New York Times and by FiveThirtyEight. The estimates adjust for a variety of factors, including the recency and sample size of a poll, whether a poll represents likely voters, and whether other polls have shifted since a poll was conducted.
We also evaluate whether each pollster: Has a track record of accuracy in recent electionsIs a member of a professional polling organizationConducts probability-based sampling
These elements factor into how much weight each poll gets in the average. And we consider pollsters that meet at least two of the three criteria to be “select pollsters,” so long as they are conducting polls for nonpartisan sponsors. Read more about our methodology.
The Times conducts its own national and state polls in partnership with Siena College. Those polls are included in the averages. Follow Times/Siena polling here.
Maine and Nebraska award two electoral votes to the statewide winner and a single electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district. (Maine has two congressional districts, and Nebraska has three.) Historical election results for these districts are calculated based on votes cast within the current boundaries of the district.

Everything you need to know about yoga, including the best yoga poses for beginners at home.
We've been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.
It's never a bad time to start practicing — and reaping the benefits of! — yoga. This ancient practice offers options for all fitness levels and has become increasingly popular in the U.S., with about one in seven Americans practicing yoga, according to a 2017 national survey. While the complex inversions and more rigorous styles can be intimidating, there are many different types of yoga that can be approachable for anyone, at any age or physical ability.
""Start with a class designed for beginners,"" says Peloton Yoga and Meditation Director Ross Rayburn. He recommends beginners kick things off by practicing just once a week and building a more regular cadence from there.
Whether you plan to join a yoga studio or you want to take a virtual yoga class from home, we've compiled everything beginners need to know about starting a regular yoga practice. Of course, before beginning any new exercise regimen, our health and fitness experts recommend consulting with your healthcare provider.
Yoga is a spiritual and physical practice rooted in Indian philosophy that has existed for thousands of years, according to the National Institutes of Health National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. There are several different styles of yoga that range from gentle, meditative experiences to more physically intense formats. The mind-body exercise typically consists of doing sequences of physical poses combined with deep breathing techniques.
""Defining 'yoga' is a bit like trying to define a grand concept like spirituality or culture,"" Rayburn says. ""I’ve always been drawn to a dynamic definition that resonates differently depending on the person, time and place. Any practice, both internal and external, that weaves intention, knowledge and affirmative agency can be yoga.""
From improving strength and flexibility to helping manage stress, the benefits of regularly practicing yoga are vast, but the specific benefits you experience will differ based on the type of yoga you do, according to Rayburn. ""Alignment-based yoga can help with strength, flexibility and functionality, while meditational or devotional types of yoga can yield myriad benefits relating to mental and emotional health,"" he says. Some generally well-established yoga health benefits include:
Improved flexibility and balance
A 2016 study in the International Journal of Yoga found improvements in flexibility and balance among a group of male college athletes that practiced yoga twice a week, for a total of 10 weeks. A systematic review from 2019 supports those findings, confirming significant improvements in yogis' lower body flexibility.
Increased strength and muscle tone
One study that evaluated adults participating in a 12-week Hatha yoga intervention saw significant improvements in both cardiorespiratory endurance and muscular strength. Another study in sedentary adults found that a Hatha yoga regimen was as good as a stretching-strengthening exercise program in improving strength, flexibility, mobility and more.
Enhanced body awareness
Yoga has been long known to improve body awareness, primarily through its ability to connect breath and movement through the practice. A pilot study in 2022 found that a 12-week yoga course for individuals with multiple sclerosis significantly improved their body awareness.
Stress relief
You may feel the stress relief benefits of yoga after just one session. Older adults who practiced yoga regularly for eight weeks reported feeling less stressed — something a salivary cortisol test supported in a 2016 study. What's more, a 2017 study found that middle-aged women secreted lower amounts of cortisol (the stress hormone) after 90 minutes of yoga, compared to resting.
Weight management
A 2013 study analysis concluded that regular yoga practice can help promote weight loss and maintenance, combined with a healthy diet. Another study from 2018 published in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity found that a regular yoga practice supported healthy eating, management of emotional eating and even increased capacity to be active.
Injury prevention
Since yoga can improve flexibility and mobility, it can be a great tool for fixing muscle imbalances and alleviating tightness than can contribute to future injuries.
Help with pain management
Scientists named yoga one of the most effective exercises for alleviating chronic pain in a 2017 study review. In a 2020 review of 25 randomized controlled trials, researchers found that 20 studies supported positive outcomes regarding yoga and back pain relief.
Manage chronic disease symptoms
Regular physical activity in general can help prevent several chronic diseases. When it comes to yoga, thousands of study participants in a year-long relaxation program involving meditation, yoga and prayer visited their doctors 43% less than the year before, according to 2015 research from Massachusetts General Hospital. Another set of studies out of UCLA found just 12 minutes of Kirtan Kriya meditation (which involves chanting and finger poses) every day for eight weeks helped decrease the immune system's inflammatory response, which is promising since inflammation levels are tied to pretty much every major disease.
When it comes to the best poses for beginners looking to start a yoga practice, Rayburn suggests starting with any of these common poses — try flowing through the sequence below to create a complete yoga workout at home.
Pro tip: Take your time and hold each movement for a few breaths before moving on to the next one.
This foundational pose can be relaxing and serve as a great reset during a class. If you ever need a second during your flow to regroup, you can always come back to child's pose.
Downward facing dog may be one of the first poses you'll learn in any yoga class, since it is an important part of many yoga practices. It's one of the main poses during sun salutations and something you can return to throughout class, as well.
Another favorite pose of Rayburn's, this one is great for stretching the lower body and opening up the chest.
This pose, also common in sun salutations, is ideal for improving posture as backbends are great for counteracting prolonged sitting.
This powerful pose is great for strengthening the legs, arms and core.
This empowering pose increases balance and strength. If you can't reach your fingertips all the way to the ground, consider utilizing a yoga block.
Great for opening the hips, this popular yoga pose targets the lower body and can provide a fantastic stretch. Ease into the movement and only fold forward if you feel stable once in position.
Another popular backbend, this pose can help improve posture and also relieve lower back pain.
Not only does this standing yoga pose help improve your balance and coordination, but it also focuses on posture and alignment. Engage your core to help steady yourself.
This grounding pose is all about relaxation and quieting the mind. If you feel any tension under your lower back, consider placing a rolled-up blanket beneath your knees.
Whether you're looking for a rigorous workout or a more meditative experience, there are a variety of yoga styles to meet your needs. Yoga was often referred to as a tree in ancient times, with six branches that include Raja (path of meditative focus), Karma (path of service), Bhakti (path of devotion), Jnana (path of wisdom and knowledge), Tantra (path of rituals) and Hatha (path that focuses on mastery of the body). You may gravitate towards one particular branch, but know that you can explore different paths and may find that many of these branches naturally overlap.
In terms of the types of yoga classes offered, some common ones you may encounter include:
If you're brand new to yoga, Rayburn says that taking a class specifically designed for beginners is ideal so you can learn proper form at the very beginning of your yoga journey. In general, you'll want to take your time with the movements and go slow, as the practice is designed to be mindful and purposeful in movement.
If your first class doesn't go as well as you wanted it to, don't get discouraged. ""Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that 'yoga is not for me' just because your first class is not the best experience,"" he says, adding that it may take a few classes to find an instructor that resonates with you and inspires you to practice regularly. Once you find the right class format and instructor, you'll start to feel more empowered by the yoga experience.
While you may be tempted to go hard in the beginning, it is crucial to listen to your body and know your limits. ""Notice if you’re not able to breathe deeply,"" suggests Rayburn. ""The breath can be a great guide for slowing down, modifying or taking a rest."" Also try to differentiate between feeling discomfort versus feeling acute sensations and pain. You can always return back to downward facing dog or child's pose whenever you need to reset during class.
Most yoga studios provide equipment, but check in advance to see if you'll need to bring anything to class. You may want to take your own mat for hygiene purposes, or if you have a particular preference on style and thickness. Some yoga studios will provide accessories for you, but if you're practicing yoga at home through a yoga app or online class, then you'll want to consider having a few things on hand:
When it comes to clothing, Rayburn says it depends on what makes you feel most comfortable. He generally recommends wearing yoga pants that allow you to move freely. Yoga is typically done barefoot, but if you prefer to wear socks, our experts suggest grip socks.

Paragraphs:
When you’re brand new to yoga, it can feel intimidating and be difficult to know exactly where and how to get started. Our Yoga for Beginners guide was created specifically for you—to give you all the tips, guidelines, and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. To ensure your success, we highly recommend you read this entire page before attempting any yoga.
Yoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body, and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment.
Hatha Yoga attains the union of mind-body-spirit through a practice of asanas (yoga postures), pranayama (yoga breathing), mudra (body gestures), and shatkarma (internal cleansing). These physical practices are used to purify the body and cultivate prana (life-force energy). Modern Hatha Yoga does not emphasize many of these esoteric practices and instead focuses more on the physical yoga postures.
Regardless of what your goals or intentions are for starting, just the yoga poses themselves is a fantastic form of mental and physical exercise.
Yoga is in no way exclusive—being able to practice yoga does not matter how old you are, how much you weigh, what you do for a living, where you live, or what religion you practice. Yoga is accessible for just about everyone.
If you have a medical condition or a recent injury, it can be challenging or dangerous to do certain types of yoga, specific poses, or breathing techniques. Usually, there are alternatives or modifications that can allow you to practice safely, and many common complaints have specific yoga therapy remedies. If you are recovering from an injury or are in poor health, we recommended consulting with a physician or other qualified health care professional before beginning yoga.
While you may feel some intensity in the belly of your muscles while in a yoga pose, you should never feel pain, especially in the joints. A sharp or intense pain is your body’s signal to tell you to stop, back off, and take it easy.
If you are out of shape or extremely inflexible, we recommend you begin with a gentle practice until you have built up the strength and flexibility for more challenging sequences. If you are a relatively fit and flexible person, you should be able to jump right into a regular hatha yoga class. Once you are familiar with the basic postures, you can explore a vinyasa or flow class. We recommend you avoid Ashtanga, Bikram, or hot yoga until you have built up some physical strength and endurance. It is always best to error on the side of caution and safety and approach yoga slowly and carefully. The best way to know if yoga is for you is to give it a try!
Yoga is typically performed in bare feet on a sticky yoga mat with optional yoga props. The yoga movements and poses require clothes that can stretch and move freely with your body. You can purchase clothing specifically designed for yoga practice, but you can probably put together a comfortable outfit from your existing wardrobe to get started.
Yoga classes may use additional props, the most common being straps, blocks, blankets, and bolsters. You don’t need to purchase these right away as you can easily substitute these items with scarves or neckties, a stack of books, and pillows. If you take classes at a yoga studio, they will provide everything that you need.
We recommend that you start with a short and straightforward yoga session and slowly build up from there. Once you feel comfortable with a few basic beginner yoga postures, you can incorporate them into a sequence and continue to add more challenging poses. Make sure you learn and follow the essential components of a yoga practice: breathing, meditation, intention, asanas, and relaxation.

If you can practice yoga 3 or more times per week, you will see significant improvements in your flexibility, range of motion, strength, balance, inner peace, and overall well being. Ideally, we recommend shorter and more frequent sessions, 20-45 minutes long, and for a total of 3-4 hours spread over several days. Practicing yoga less than this amount will still be beneficial, but you will see smaller improvements over a longer period of time. Like most things, the more time you can dedicate towards it, the more benefits you will receive.

The benefits of yoga are almost endless! Practicing yoga helps build healthy virtues and good values, such as discipline, honesty, devotion, self-inquiry, mindfulness, and non-attachment. Yoga empowers you to make conscious choices toward living a more healthy and fulfilling life. Yoga also helps you:
Patience, commitment, repetition, and consistency are the keys to developing and progressing in the practice of yoga. After you’ve found a style, teacher, and yoga studio that works for you, try these tips:

Practice Yoga for BeginnersOur Yoga for Beginners guide will give you the basic tips, guidelines and recommendations you will need to start a successful yoga practice. Meditation BasicsMeditation is a focusing of the mind on a single object, creating the cessation of all thought. As thoughts dissipate, the mind becomes quiet, and we are able to be fully in the present moment. The techniques of meditation are simple and easy to learn, but the ability to keep the mind focused takes time, patience and practice. The benefits of a regular meditation practice include reduction of stress, tension, anxiety and frustration, as well as improved memory, concentration, inner peace and whole body well-being. PranayamaPranayama are breathing exercises developed by the ancient yogis for purification. Prana translates into “life force energy” and Yama translates into “control or mastery of”. Thus, Pranyama is used to control, cultivate, and modify the Prana in the body. Prana is taken in through the air we breathe, and since the pranayama exercises increase the amount of air we take in, they also increase our intake of Prana. For all pranayama (except Kapalabhati), the breath is slow and steady, breathed in and out of the nose and down into the belly. Always sit with a straight spine and a relaxed body. While you are practicing pranayama, let go of any thoughts by focusing on the breathing involved with the pranayama. Yoga Postures Seated Yoga Poses Standing Yoga Poses Prone Yoga Poses Supine Yoga Poses Yoga Posture Sequences Warm-up SequencesUse these sequences of simple stretches to warm up prior to any of the pose sequences. Basic SequencesWhere to start if you are new or a beginner. These posture flows are simple, short and only contain basic postures. Beginning SequencesWhere to start if you have some previous experience with yoga. Build on the basic pose sequences by adding more length and challenge to the flow. For more beginning level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Sun SalutationsOften considered the core of hatha yoga practice, Sun Salutations are traditionally practiced at sunrise to warm and energize the body. We have several Sun Salutation sequences available with varying levels of difficulty, from basic to intermediate. Intermediate SequencesBy adding challenging postures to the beginning sequences, these posture flows are the most complex, vigorous and long. For more intermediate level sequences, check out the Sun Salutations and the Special Sequences sections. Special SequencesLooking for something different? These sequences are designed for specific applications, using combinations of yoga postures for their effects on the physical, mental, emotional and energetic bodies.

Learn Yoga 101: The BasicsYoga is a vast collection of spiritual techniques and practices aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit to achieve a state of enlightenment or oneness with the universe. What is normally thought of as “yoga” in the West is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga. The different paths of yoga emphasize different approaches and techniques, but ultimately lead to the same goal of unification and enlightenment. Though yoga’s ultimate aim is lofty, its essence is practical and scientific as it emphasizes direct experience and observable results. It is not a religion, but a practice of personal inquiry and exploration. As the cultural and religious diversity of practitioners attest, yogic philosophy speaks to universal truths that can be incorporated within any belief system. Philosophy of YogaThe main philosophy of yoga is simple: mind, body and spirit are all one and cannot be clearly separated. Yet there is a multitude of philosophical ideas developed by looking into the deeper dimensions of the body, mind and spirit. Energy AnatomyThe foundation of all life, of the whole universe, is the subtle life force energy the yogis call ‘prana.’ This mystical energy flows through our bodies and generates our every action – from gross physical movements to minute biochemical processes.Hatha and Tantra yogas have developed a rich description of the anatomy of the subtle or energy body, including the different types of energies, the nadi energy channels and chakra energy centers. These yogas have also developed various methods to increase, cultivate and direct this spiritual energy. Articles on Hatha Yoga Yoga TherapyYoga Therapy is the use of yoga postures, meditation and pranayama to help the body naturally heal and balance itself. Certain yogic practices have been shown to have specific healing qualities in addition to yoga’s inherent ability to create wellness and good health. These pages are not intended to treat or diagnose any medical conditions. A yoga practice should be used to supplement conventional therapy. Please consult with a health care professional before starting a yoga program, as some yogic techniques can be harmful if practiced with certain conditions. Please see our site’s terms and conditions for our complete disclaimer. The postures listed under each condition are for general use and will be most effective if professionally modified for personal use by a yoga therapist. Not all of the postures listed are required for practice, use only what feels right for your physical condition and ability. These pages are only a starting point to help your body heal. Experiment and pay attention to what practices make you feel better and improve your condition. Practice slowly and gently as over exertion could cause your condition to worsen. Yoga Therapy Guides:

Works well. Recommend.
I ended up giving it away to a new up coming Chef in the making. He loves it and is happy using it.
This is a wonderful little food processor for those who are single and do not need to prepare a big meal. My daughter saw it and she said when she needs to make a smaller portion she'll come borrow it.
This is wonderful!! It's great for me, as I only cook for 1, or 2 at the most. Fast, easy, and easy clean up!!
So glad I bought this. Just the right size. Use it more then I thought I would.
Remind me about upcoming Cuisinart shows.

Pulse action is best when you are using the chop function. Two or three pulses are often enough. Be sure to check the food frequently to prevent overprocessing.
If you overprocess, you are likely to get a watery paste instead of a fine chop.
Use the grind function for grinding spices, and for chopping hard food such as peppercorns, seeds, chocolate and nuts.
Continuous-hold action is best when you are using the grind function. You may have to operate the Mini-Prep Plus Processor for several seconds with some food to achieve the desired results.
Large enough for most chopping/grinding jobs, small enough to store easily

""I had to come here to say something. Normally I have excruciating pain with crest white strips and this other brand I got from the dentist. Both of which didn’t whiten my teeth very much. So, I had low hopes for laughland. I got the formula made for highest sensitivity, and I left it on for I think 12 minutes. Just after the first day my teeth look 2 shades whiter. I’m actually really shocked.""

Laughland is the only whitening brand to create custom whitening formulas based on your quiz profile. Just as a dentist would prescribe a specific whitening treatment for you, we can optimize the strength of the whitening serum to your unique sensitivity levels, dental history and diet. Hence, our formulas are 3x more effective and clinically tested to show a 74% improvement in whiteness. It's the closest you'll get to a dentist, without having to go to one!
While you'll begin to see differences after your first 10+ minute treatment, but the most noticeable changes will come after 6 days of consecutive whitening treatments. You'll be pleasantly surprised :)
Each kit contains 3 syringes that last for 6 treatments. Results can be immediately noticeable, and lasts months depending on your diet and brushing habits. We recommend users to re-whiten every 2-3 months or as-needed to maintain a shine all year round.
Veneers, caps, implants, bonding or bridges aren’t designed to be whitened, however Laughland can whiten the surrounding teeth to maintain the same shade as your dental work.
We offer a flexible subscription to save you the trouble of re-ordering manually.
You can manage your subscription via your account or by emailing us at team@mylaughland.com anytime.
Our NanoLight technology LED light helps with teeth whitening by activating the ingredients in the whitening gel used during the treatment. Your custom gel contains a variety of bleaching agents that breaks down the stains on the surface of the teeth. When the light is shone on the teeth, it activates the whitening gel, speeding up the chemical reaction and helping the bleaching agent penetrate deeper into the enamel. This results in a more effective and efficient teeth whitening treatment, giving you a brighter and more confident smile. It is important to note that the LED light alone will not change the color of your teeth, but rather enhances the effectiveness of the whitening gel.

Reddit's best place for all things yoga.
If you want to learn how to do yoga, you’re in the right place! It will transform your life, but I’ll be the first to admit it can be intimidating to start. What are the poses? What do I wear? Where do I go? It’s a bit overwhelming, but it doesn’t need to be.
Here are a couple resources for you to check out when you have some time:
https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene Disclaimer: I've never actually taken her classes, but the online world raves about her videos. She offers a large variety, so this could be a great place to start. And they are free (yay!)
Just by the titles, these are the ones I would start with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7AYKMP6rOE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiKJRoX_2uo
Adriene also had a 30 day yoga series that could be worth trying too.
I've done a different 30 day challenge from another girl (Erin Motz - The Bad Yogi) and it was a great way to become familiar with the poses and practice regularly. BONUS: the videos are pretty short so it's easy to fit into your schedule and they are free. Here is the link to day one of her 30 day series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbrutThDk7o
This is my FAVORITE yogi of all time - Rachel Brathen. She is @yoga_girl on insta and I went to her yoga retreat a few years ago and it was amazing. UGH I want to go back! https://oneoeight.com/?gclid=CMX6odvfiNECFdU8gQodmQoMrg I pay $14/month for these classes but they have a 10 day free trial you could check out. They have a huge variety of teachers on there, but I've only taken Rachel's classes and they are so good! and kick my ass. I believe they also have meditation on here (I've never tried it) but that could be cool too.
Anyways - this should be good to at least get you started at home. If you find you're interested it would be worth going to a studio (or two) and see which ones you like. I recommend two things: Try to find a groupon. You can get amazing deals this way! See what new student discounts the studio offers. Many of them have a special deal for students who have never been there before Okay, I just thought of a third point… search for local community (or donation based) yoga classes. I usually donate $5-10 per class.
There you have it! My favorite resources to kick start your yoga practice. Of course - if you have any questions you can ask me. I am here to help :)

If you’re a beginner to yoga, it can seem intimidating. Between the gravity-defying poses you see on Instagram and the overwhelming array of class options, it can be easy to think of yoga as exclusive. The truth is, yoga is for everyone and you don’t need gymnast-level flexibility to give it a try. In fact, the reason you do yoga isn’t because you’re flexible—it’s to become more flexible in your body as well as your life.
Here, you’ll find everything you need to know about yoga for beginners: the benefits of a regular practice, beginner poses, how to find the right class for you, practicing at home, and more.
The word “yoga” derives from a Sanskrit word that means “to yoke” or “to unite.” This makes sense when you consider that yoga is a practice meant to unite the mind, body, and spirit.
Much of the yoga practiced in the West today focuses strongly on asana, meaning the physical practice, but the physical postures are just one aspect of yoga. There are ancient philosophical texts that define yoga as a state of mind that has nothing to do with physical postures and movements.
“Yoga” is a very old term that originated in India, explains Indu Arora, an Ayurveda and yoga therapist and author of Yoga: Ancient Heritage, Tomorrow’s Vision. “Its roots are found in ancient texts called Vedas, which are about 3,000- to 5,000-year-old texts,” she says.
As Arora explains, yoga is “that harmonious, peaceful, content, still state of mind. Whenever we have found that, we are in that state of yoga.”
That’s why focusing on your breath—pranayama—is considered an essential component of yoga. “Prana” refers to life force or breath sustaining the body; “ayama” means “to extend” or “to draw out.” The two together mean breath extension or control. Some yoga teachers consider pranayama as the most important part of the practice.
When you begin to practice yoga regularly, you’ll unlock a host of health benefits. Because yoga engages the mind, body, and spirit, these span the physical, mental, and emotional realms.
The moving, stretching, and deep breathing during a yoga practice improves blood flow and both stretches and strengthens muscles.
Yoga shows promise for relieving certain kinds of chronic and acute pain—especially low back pain, according to research.
Factors such as stress and a sedentary lifestyle can trigger chronic inflammation, which in turn can raise your risk for disease. Yoga may be a powerful antidote. Studies have found that practicing yoga may help lower blood levels of an inflammation-promoting immune cell called IL-6 and cortisol, also known as the “stress hormone.”
The evidence is overwhelming: Yoga appears to be an effective way to boost heart health, help manage heart conditions, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Yoga has been found to help decrease depressive symptoms and significantly reduce stress and anxiety. Research continues to find that meditation is effective in relieving symptoms of depression as well.
The practice of holding postures, breathing intentionally, and meditating all train you to fine-tune your attention by syncing your breathing with movement, focusing on the subtleties of your inhalations and exhalations, and letting go of distracting thoughts.
Studies have also shown that a regular yoga practice promotes positive emotions and body image. “Yoga has helped me to deal with life struggles,” says Kiesha Battles, yoga teacher and trainer, and co-director of the Yoga Retreat for Women of Color. “It allows me to have more clarity in the way I see things so that I can deal with troubles or problems.”
When practiced consistently, yoga may help reduce the time it takes you to fall asleep, decrease sleep disturbances, and improve sleep quality.
RELATED The Benefits of Yoga: 38 Ways Yoga Can Improve Your Life
If you’ve ever browsed yoga class schedules, you’ve likely encountered a slew of options—including some with names that you don’t understand. These typically signify various types of yoga with approaches that vary in intensity, focus, and styles. Following are some styles of yoga you may encounter:
Here are six basic yoga poses that are beginner-friendly. There are many variations of each yoga pose that can help make them more accessible to your unique body.
Although it may look like a simple standing position, Mountain Pose engages your leg muscles and your core, while establishing greater body awareness and alignment.
How to:
Cat Pose can help relieve tension in your low, middle, and upper back, as well as improve posture. This pose is often paired with Cow Pose (see below) for a gentle flow. How to:
Cow Pose can be done on your hands and knees, or even in a seated position during chair yoga. Cow Pose may help increase mobility, especially for people experiencing muscle and joint stiffness. How to:
Cobra Pose may help improve symptoms of chronic low back pain by increasing flexibility and core strength. Though you may see yogis straightening their arms and more deeply arching their backs, it’s okay to stay low to the ground, especially if you’re new to Cobra Pose.
How to:
Child’s Pose and its variations provide a stretch for the lower back and hips. This pose is often recommended for yogis to return to throughout a class or sequence.
How to:
Yogis rest in Savasana at the end of each practice. This pose offers a chance to find inner stillness after the physical movement of a yoga class.
Savasana may provide deep relaxation, which promotes stress reduction.
How to:
There are many different breathwork, or pranayama, techniques, including simply slowing your breath. Another common and traditional form of breathwork is Ujjayi. This type of breathing pattern is approximately equal length inhalations and exhalations and should feel both energizing and relaxing. It’s created by gently constricting the opening of the throat to create some resistance to the passage of air. An effective Ujjayi breath renders a soothing sound.
At the beginning of class, a yoga teacher may guide students through one or more breathing techniques, including Ujjayi as well as:

It’s normal if you feel awkward when you first start practicing yogic breathwork. Try to be patient with yourself and over time, you may become more comfortable and reap the benefits breathwork can offer.
In a study in the International Journal of Yoga, researchers found that pranayama is linked with stress relief, improved cardiovascular health and respiratory function, and enhanced cognition.
A well-known saying goes something like “Movement with awareness is yoga. Movement without awareness is exercise.” That awareness includes attention to your breath as you move throughout the poses.

In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, a text compiled by an ancient sage named Patanjali, many different concepts of yoga are brought together under one umbrella, Arora explains. The result is structured guidance on how to achieve a yogic state of mind.
As Patanjali explains, yoga encompasses eight limbs (or steps) that essentially serve as guidelines on how to live a meaningful and purposeful life. These limbs are a prescription for moral and ethical conduct and self-discipline, direct attention toward one’s health, and help us acknowledge the spiritual aspects of our nature as humans.
The eight limbs of yoga are:
You don’t need to know a ton about how to do yoga before you attend your first class. “That’s why you’re there—you’re there to learn,” says Susanna Barkataki, yoga teacher trainer and author of Embrace Yoga’s Roots: Courageous Ways to Deepen Your Yoga Practice.
Start by doing a Google search for “Beginner yoga classes near me.” Some yoga studios have class schedules on their websites while others use apps. Most studios prefer that students reserve classes ahead of time, which you can often do online, in order to ensure classes aren’t overbooked and students aren’t turned away at the door.
Classes that are described as foundational, gentle, or beginner are great options if you’re just starting out. So are restorative or yin yoga classes.
Of course, it may help to email or call your local yoga studio to ask whether a particular class is beginner-friendly. If you have any injuries or health conditions, you may also choose to disclose that to the studio or the teacher, who can advise you on which of their classes would best suit your needs.
If you want to try beginner yoga at home before ever stepping foot into a studio, there are tons of free resources online for yogis. Check out these 10-minute beginner yoga videos:

There is no dress code for most yoga classes. But you’ll want to make sure that the fabric you wear is stretchy enough to accommodate movement. While yoga pants are popular, you can wear gym shorts, sweatpants, a sweat-wicking workout top, a t-shirt, a sports bra—anything you’re most comfortable in.
If it’s your first time going to yoga class at a studio, you most likely don’t need to bring anything (aside from a water bottle to stay hydrated). It’s common practice for people to rent a yoga mat from the studio or bring their own. If you borrow a mat, many studios provide sanitizing wipes so you can clean the mat before and after use.
As you practice more, you’ll learn what you need for a comfortable experience. You may choose to purchase your own yoga mat and even, if you practice at home, other props such as blocks and blankets.
Using props is about making yoga comfortable and accessible for you. Yoga instructors will often show various modifications for a single pose using props that the studio provides.
Common yoga props include:
Keep in mind that yoga is a mind-body-spirit practice that is about much more than just fitness. So if your yoga class incorporates some non-movement elements—such as breathwork, meditation, or intention-setting (sankalpa) at the beginning of class—be open to those aspects of the practice.
In India, where yoga originated, it’s a sign of respect to remove your shoes before you enter someone’s home, temple, or practice space. The same is expected in a yoga class.
While many teachers provide hands-on adjustments for students, know that you have the right to decline. Some teachers may ask students to raise their hands at the beginning of class if they do not wish to be touched throughout a practice. You can also tell your teacher directly before the practice begins. Always speak up if any hands-on adjustments make you feel uncomfortable in any way. “I think that’s another piece of the etiquette going both ways,” says Barkataki.
Many, but certainly not all, yoga teachers call poses by their Sanskrit names, in addition to or instead of their English interpretations. Don’t feel like you need to brush up on this ancient Indian language before taking your first yoga class. However, it’s helpful to understand the meaning of certain well-known Sanskrit words and phrases. If you hear something in class you don’t understand, simply ask the teacher to explain it to you after class.
The following are some common yoga terms:

Basic Yoga Class Etiquette
Common Yoga Terms
Vinyasa Yoga: Vinyasa classes typically comprise a sequence of poses that are moved through with one movement per breath.
Restorative Yoga: A Restorative yoga class typically involves only five or six relaxing poses—supported by props, such as blankets, bolsters, pillows, blocks, or stacks of books—that you linger in for several minutes. The postures are designed to help you to release tension and rest.
Hot Yoga: Any style of yoga practiced in an intentionally heated room is hot yoga. The temperature is believed to encourage increased flexibility, although it’s important to exert caution.
Yin Yoga: A relatively recently developed style, Yin yoga involves variations of seated and supine stretches that are typically held for 3 to 5 minutes to access fascia, a type of connective tissue that is the subject of much research. Exerting subtle tension on fascia can improve flexibility and minimize recovery time from injuries.
Ashtanga Yoga: An athletic and demanding practice based on several set sequences of postures that remain the same, an Ashtanga yoga practice is taught in increasing levels of difficulty. Beginners start with the Primary Series.
Hatha Yoga: Unlike vinyasa, Hatha yoga focuses on individual poses and not the linking of poses from one to the next. The practice is meant to deepen your understanding of each pose.
Yoga Therapy: Any yogic technique used to systematically address physical injury or pain, as well as mental and emotional stress or trauma, can be considered yoga therapy.
Iyengar Yoga: By paying careful attention to the alignment of each posture, Iyengar yoga is the practice of precision. Poses are held for extended periods of time and students are often supported with props to experience the posture’s intended alignment.
Jivamukti Yoga: This style of yoga is defined by incorporating chanting, meditation, pranayama, philosophy, and music into a vigorous vinyasa practice. Jivamukti is a physically and intellectually stimulating type of yoga.
Kundalini Yoga: A blend of spiritual and physical practices, Kundalini yoga includes less of an emphasis on movement and more on dynamic breathing techniques, meditation, and the chanting of mantras.
Power Yoga: This practice flows from one pose to the next. Power yoga has many of the same qualities as Ashtanga and some types of vinyasa, including building internal heat, increasing stamina, enhancing strength and flexibility, as well as reducing stress.
Prenatal Yoga: With an emphasis on breathing, stamina, pelvic floor work, restorative poses, and core strength, prenatal yoga can be practiced both during and after pregnancy.
Tantra Yoga: By harnessing and embodying the five forces of Shakti, the divine feminine that represents creativity and change, tantric yoga intends to help you move through the world with more confidence and contentment.
Stand with your big toes touching, heels slightly apart.
Reach your tailbone toward the floor.
Broaden your collarbones and let your arms hang at your sides, palms facing forward.
Hold Mountain Pose for up to 10 breaths.
Start on your hands and knees with your knees directly below your hips and your wrists, elbows, and shoulders in line.
As you exhale, round your spine toward the ceiling and release your head toward the floor without forcing your chin to your chest.
Repeat Cat Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Start on your hands and knees. Make sure your knees are directly below your hips and your wrists; elbows and shoulders are in line.
As you inhale, lift your sitting bones and chest toward the ceiling, allowing your belly to sink toward the floor. Lift your head to look straight forward.
Exhale, coming back to your hands and knees.
Repeat Cow Pose (or Cat-Cow) 5 to 10 times.
Lie on your stomach with your palms on the floor, fingertips in line with the middle of your chest. Place a folded towel or blanket underneath your hip bones for added cushioning. Extend your legs.
Slowly press your palms into the floor and draw your shoulder blades together. Keep your shoulders down.
Keep a deep bend in both arms as you expand your chest forward.
Hold for 5 to 10 breaths and slowly lower yourself back down to the floor.
Begin in a seated position with your bottom on top of your feet, placing a rolled blanket or towel in between if it’s more comfortable.
Touch your big toes together and widen your knees out to the side as you slowly walk your hands out in front of you.
Bring your forehead to the floor. If it’s more accessible, place a book, block, or blanket beneath your forehead.
Stay in this position anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. To come out of Child’s Pose, slowly walk your hands back toward your body and rise up to seated.
Lie down slowly onto your back and soften (but don’t flatten) your lower back onto the floor. If it’s more comfortable, support the back of your head and neck on a folded blanket or towel.
Release your arms to the floor. Rest the backs of your hands on the floor. Make sure your shoulder blades are resting evenly on the floor.
Soften your tongue to the bottom of your mouth. Relax your face.
Try to stay in this pose for at least 5 minutes at the end of your practice. To exit, first roll gently with an exhalation onto one side. Take 2 or 3 breaths. With another exhalation press your hands against the floor and lift your torso, dragging your head slowly after. Your head should always come up last.
Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)
Cooling Breath (Shitali Pranayama)
Breath of Fire (Kapalabhati Pranayama)
Yama (ethical standards toward others)
Niyama (self-discipline and inner observances)
Asana (physical postures, which many Westerners think of as yoga)
Pranayama (breath control)
Pratyahara (sensory transcendence)
Dharana (concentration)
Dhyana (meditation)
Samadhi (self-realization)
Yoga mats: You may be surprised to learn that yoga mats are not a must, says Jivana Heyman, founder of Accessible Yoga. “You really don’t have to use a yoga mat unless you really want that stickiness, that extra traction,” he explains. In lieu of a mat, you could practice on wood floors, with a towel, or on carpeting, especially if you’re practicing at home.
Yoga Blanket: This item is a staple in restorative yoga and can also be used to support your knees, wrists, and back throughout any practice. Look for a blanket that is thick in texture to ensure you have adequate support, Battles advises.
Yoga Blocks: Blocks are another common prop that effectively brings the floor to you in various poses and adds stability and balance to your practice. Blocks are often used by beginner and experienced yogis alike to help them work within the limitations of their bodies and allow them to find alignment with less strain.
Yoga Straps: Straps, explains Battles, extend your reach in postures. If you have a stiff lower back or tight hamstrings, for example, the strap allows you to find alignment in more poses. You can buy a yoga strap or instead use a long, flexible item like a towel, belt, sweatshirt, or tie.
Asana: Refers to the physical practice of yoga or poses
Chakra: Relates to the seven energetic parts of the body that we can’t see or touch but that connect us to universal energy
Mantra: A word or phrase that is repeated during yoga practice and meditation
Namaste: A sign of respect often said between yoga teachers and their students at the end of class

Paragraphs:
The British government has banned the phrase fake news from appearing in official papers or documents after ruling the term is ""poorly defined and misleading.""
Instead, ministers will have to use the words disinformation when referring to the act of purposely spreading false information and misinformation when it occurs inadvertently.
The suggestion to ban the phrase often used by President Donald Trump during his attacks on the media was made in a report by the U.K. Parliament's Digital Culture Media and Sport Committee, as the term fake news is ""bandied around with no clear idea of what it means.""
""The term has taken on a variety of meanings, including a description of any statement that is not liked or agreed with by the reader,"" the recommendation said.
The British government responded: ""We agree that 'fake news' is a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.
""Over the past several months during its work on this issue the Government has sought to move away from 'fake news' and instead has sought to address 'disinformation' and wider online manipulation.
""In our work we have defined disinformation as the deliberate creation and sharing of false and/or manipulated information that is intended to deceive and mislead audiences, either for the purposes of causing harm, or for political, personal or financial gain. 'Misinformation' refers to the inadvertent sharing of false information.""
However, British politicians will still be allowed to use the phrase if they wish while speaking in the House of Commons, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Avoiding the phrase was one of 42 recommendations made in the committee's report, titled ""Disinformation and 'Fake News.'"" The interim report, published in July, warned that ""democracy is at risk"" if more isn't done to combat alleged foreign interference in elections or the use of manipulation of personal data to spread disinformation.
The interim report was set up in the wake of continuing concerns over Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
Only three of the report's 42 recommendations were accepted outright by the British government, with four recommendations rejected, the committee confirmed in a statement.
Damian Collins, the committee's chair and a Conservative member of Parliament for Folkestone and Hythe, said he is ""disappointed"" by the government's response to the report.
""We need to see a more coordinated approach across government to combat campaigns of disinformation being organized by Russian agencies seeking to disrupt and undermine our democracy,"" Collins said. ""The government's response gives us no real indication of what action is being taken on this important issue.""

Paragraphs:
Conspiracy theories claiming 5G technology helps transmit coronavirus have been condemned by the scientific community.
Videos have been shared on social media showing mobile phone masts on fire in Birmingham and Merseyside - along with the claims.
The UK's mobile networks have reported 20 cases of masts being targeted in suspected arson attacks over the Easter weekend, including damage to a mast providing mobile connectivity to Birmingham's Nightingale Hospital.
The posts have been shared on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram - including by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers.
TV regulator Ofcom is assessing comments made by presenter Eamonn Holmes in which he cast doubts on media outlets for their attempts to debunk the claims.
But scientists say the idea of a connection between Covid-19 and 5G is ""complete rubbish"" and biologically impossible.
The conspiracy theories have been branded ""the worst kind of fake news"" by NHS England Medical Director Stephen Powis.
Many of those sharing the post are pushing a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that 5G - which is used in mobile phone networks and relies on signals carried by radio waves - is somehow responsible for coronavirus.
These theories appear to have first emerged via Facebook posts in late January, around the same time the first cases were recorded in the US.
They appear to fall broadly in to two camps:
One claims 5G can suppress the immune system, thus making people more susceptible to catching the virus.
The other suggests the virus can somehow be transmitted through the use of 5G technology.
Both these notions are ""complete rubbish,"" says Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading.
Masts caught fire in Birmingham and Merseyside, prompting investigations
""The idea that 5G lowers your immune system doesn't stand up to scrutiny,"" Dr Clarke says.
""Your immune system can be dipped by all sorts of thing - by being tired one day, or not having a good diet. Those fluctuations aren't huge but can make you more susceptible to catching viruses.""
While very strong radio waves can cause heating, 5G is nowhere near strong enough to heat people up enough to have any meaningful effect.
""Radio waves can disrupt your physiology as they heat you up, meaning your immune system can't function. But [the energy levels from] 5G radio waves are tiny and they are nowhere near strong enough to affect the immune system. There have been lots of studies on this.""
The radio waves involved in 5G and other mobile phone technology sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not strong enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays.
It would also be impossible for 5G to transmit the virus, Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, adds.
""The present epidemic is caused by a virus that is passed from one infected person to another. We know this is true. We even have the virus growing in our lab, obtained from a person with the illness. Viruses and electromagnetic waves that make mobile phones and internet connections work are different things. As different as chalk and cheese,"" he says.
It's also important to note another major flaw with the conspiracy theories - coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Iran that have yet to roll out the technology.
There were plenty of scare stories about 5G circulating before the coronavirus outbreak which Reality Check has already looked into, such as this piece: Does 5G pose health risks?
Earlier this year, a long-running study from the watchdog the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) rebutted these claims, saying there was no evidence that mobile networks cause cancer or other illnesses.
But if anything, the misinformation seems to have escalated.
Trade body Mobile UK has said false rumours and theories linking 5G and coronavirus were ""concerning,"" while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has reiterated there is ""absolutely no credible evidence for the link"".
Viruses invade human or animal cells and use them to reproduce, which is what causes infection. Viruses cannot live very long outside a living thing, so they have to find a way in - usually via droplets of liquid from coughs or sneezes.
Genome sequencing of this coronavirus suggests it jumped from animals to humans - and then began to pass from human to human.

h1: How Teens In The Balkans Are Duping Trump Supporters With Fake News
h2: Sections
h2: Company
h2: Follow Us

Paragraphs:
BuzzFeed News identified more than 100 pro-Trump websites being run from a single town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
BuzzFeed Founding Editor, Canada
BuzzFeed Contributor
""This is the news of the millennium!"" said the story on WorldPoliticus.com. Citing unnamed FBI sources, it claimed Hillary Clinton will be indicted in 2017 for crimes related to her email scandal.
""Your Prayers Have Been Answered,"" declared the headline.
For Trump supporters, that certainly seemed to be the case. They helped the baseless story generate over 140,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook.
Meanwhile, roughly 6,000 miles away in a small town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a young man watched as money began trickling into his Google AdSense account.
Over the past year, the Macedonian town of Veles (population 45,000) has experienced a digital gold rush as locals launched at least 140 US politics websites. These sites have American-sounding domain names such as WorldPoliticus.com, TrumpVision365.com, USConservativeToday.com, DonaldTrumpNews.co, and USADailyPolitics.com. They almost all publish aggressively pro-Trump content aimed at conservatives and Trump supporters in the US.
The young Macedonians who run these sites say they don't care about Donald Trump. They are responding to straightforward economic incentives: As Facebook regularly reveals in earnings reports, a US Facebook user is worth about four times a user outside the US. The fraction-of-a-penny-per-click of US display advertising — a declining market for American publishers — goes a long way in Veles. Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook — and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters.
As a result, this strange hub of pro-Trump sites in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is now playing a significant role in propagating the kind of false and misleading content that was identified in a recent BuzzFeed News analysis of hyperpartisan Facebook pages. These sites open a window into the economic incentives behind producing misinformation specifically for the wealthiest advertising markets and specifically for Facebook, the world's largest social network, as well as within online advertising networks such as Google AdSense.
""Yes, the info in the blogs is bad, false, and misleading but the rationale is that 'if it gets the people to click on it and engage, then use it,'"" said a university student in Veles who started a US politics site, and who agreed to speak on the condition that BuzzFeed News not use his name.
Sample stories from US politics sites run by Macedonians.
Using domain name registration records and online searches, BuzzFeed News identified over 100 active US politics websites being run from Veles. The largest of these sites have Facebook pages that boast hundreds of thousands of followers.
BuzzFeed News also identified another 40 US politics domains registered by people in Veles that are no longer active. (An April report from the Macedonian website Meta.mk identified six pro-Trump sites being run from Veles. A Guardian report identified 150 politics sites.)
Their reasons for launching these sites are purely financial, according to the Macedonians with whom BuzzFeed News spoke.
""I started the site for a easy way to make money,"" said a 17-year-old who runs a site with four other people. ""In Macedonia the economy is very weak and teenagers are not allowed to work, so we need to find creative ways to make some money. I'm a musician but I can't afford music gear. Here in Macedonia the revenue from a small site is enough to afford many things.""
Most of the posts on these sites are aggregated, or completely plagiarized, from fringe and right-wing sites in the US. The Macedonians see a story elsewhere, write a sensationalized headline, and quickly post it to their site. Then they share it on Facebook to try and generate traffic. The more people who click through from Facebook, the more money they earn from ads on their website.
Earlier in the year, some in Veles experimented with left-leaning or pro–Bernie Sanders content, but nothing performed as well on Facebook as Trump content.
""People in America prefer to read news about Trump,"" said a Macedonian 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com.
BuzzFeed News' research also found that the most successful stories from these sites were nearly all false or misleading.
For example, the most successful post BuzzFeed News found from a Macedonian site is based on a story from a fake news website. The headline on the story from ConservativeState.com was ""Hillary Clinton In 2013: 'I Would Like To See People Like Donald Trump Run For Office; They’re Honest And Can’t Be Bought.'"" The post is a week old and has racked up an astounding 480,000 shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. (To put that into perspective, the New York Times' exclusive story that revealed Donald Trump declared a $916 million loss on his 1995 income tax returns generated a little more than 175,000 Facebook interactions in a month.)
The viral Clinton story was sourced from TheRightists.com, a site that admits it publishes both real and fake content. According to emails released by WikiLeaks, Clinton said in a private speech to Goldman Sachs that she would like to see more successful business people enter politics. But she did not mention Donald Trump in any way. The quote used in the headline is false.
The original hoax from The Rightists.
Four of the five most successful posts from the Macedonian sites BuzzFeed News identified are false. They include the false claim that the pope endorsed Trump, and the false claim that Mike Pence said Michelle Obama is the ""most vulgar first lady we've ever had."" Those four posts together generated more than 1 million shares, reactions, and comments on Facebook. That resulted in huge traffic and significant ad revenue for the owners of these sites, with many people being misinformed along the way.
The Macedonians BuzzFeed News spoke to said the explosion in pro-Trump sites in Veles means the market has now become crowded, making it harder to earn money. The people who launched their sites early in 2016 are making the most money, according to the university student. He said a friend of his earns $5,000 per month, ""or even $3,000 per day"" when he gets a hit on Facebook.
The 16-year-old who operates BVANews.com with a partner said he also runs health websites in addition to the US politics site. They launched the site in early 2016 and it's now averaging 1 million page views a month, said his partner. (The teens declined to share revenue figures.)
The 17-year-old and his three partners are still waiting for Google's AdSense program to approve their site for ads. As of now, they're only generating about 800 views a day and aren't earning any revenue. The university student launched his site in August and stopped updating it in order to focus on another, more successful site he has that's focused on health and well-being. He estimated there are ""thousands"" of health-related sites being run out of Veles. US politics is just this year's opportunity, thanks to a combination of Trump and Facebook.
""I stopped because I didn't really enjoy doing it and we didn't actually make any money from it since there are so many people posting already,"" the university student said. ""The people who started early are the ones reaping the rewards.""
Aside from the allure of easy money, they also have an element of pride that web-savvy people — including teenagers — in a small country like Macedonia can earn money by gaming Facebook, Google, and Americans.
""A good chunk of the world thinks Macedonia is primitive, but that is not true,"" the 17-year-old said.
The young men running these sites know the Trump traffic bonanza will soon come to an end. They expect traffic and revenue to decline significantly once the election is over. But they also hold out hope that a Trump win will keep their sites afloat.
""If Trump loses I plan to redirect my site to sports,"" the 16-year-old's partner said. ""It means that there will be no more politics [worth covering].""

Paragraphs:
Deepfake videos are a portmanteau word - 'deep' from 'deep learning' and 'fake', obviously, from 'fake'. Deep learning is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) method which uses multiple layers of machine learning algorithms to extract progressively higher-level features from raw input. It's capable of learning from unstructured data - such as the human face. For instance, an AI can gather data on your physical movements.
That data can then be processed in order to create a Deepfake video through a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). This is another kind of specialized machine learning system. Two neural networks are used to compete with each other in learning the characteristics of a training set (for instance, photographs of faces) and then generating new data with the same characteristics (new 'photographs').
Because such a network keeps testing the images it creates against the training set, the fake images become increasingly convincing. This makes Deepfake an ever more potent threat. Plus, GANs can fake other data besides photos and video. In fact, the same Deepfake machine learning and synthesizing techniques can be used to fake voices.

High profile Deepfake examples are not hard to find. One example of a Deepfake is the video issued by actor Jordan Peele in which he used real footage of Barack Obama merged with his own impression of Obama to issue a warning against Deepfake videos. He then showed how the two halves of the merged video looked when separated. His advice? We need to question what we see.
A video of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appearing to talk about how Facebook ’controls the future’ via stolen user data - notably on Instagram. The original video comes from a speech he gave on Russian election interference - just 21 seconds of that speech were enough to synthesize the new video. However, the voice impersonation wasn't as good as Jordan Peele's Obama and gave the truth away.
But even less well-made fakes can have a remarkable impact. A video of Nancy Pelosi 'drunk' scored millions of views on YouTube – but it was simply a fake made by slowing down a video artificially to give the effect of her slurring her words. And many celebrity women have found themselves 'starring' in revenge porn made by morphing their faces into porn films and images.
Deepfake videos have been used for political purposes, as well as for personal revenge. But increasingly they're being used in major attempts at blackmail and fraud.
The CEO of a British energy firm was tricked out of $243,000 by a voice Deepfake of the head of his parent company requesting an emergency transfer of funds. The fake was so convincing that he didn't think to check; the funds were wired not to the head office, but to a third party's bank account. The CEO only became suspicious when his 'boss' requested another transfer. This time, alarm bells rang - but it was too late to get back the funds he'd already transferred.
In France, a recent fraud didn't use Deepfake tech, but used impersonation, together with meticulous copying of Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian's office and its furnishings, to defraud senior executives of millions of euros. Fraudster Gilbert Chikli is alleged to have disguised himself as the minister to ask wealthy individuals and company executives for ransom money to liberate French hostages in Syria; he's currently standing trial.

It's also possible that Deepfake authors could blackmail company presidents by threatening to publish a damaging Deepfake video unless they're paid off. Or intruders could get into your network simply by synthesizing a video call from your Chief Information Officer, tricking employees into giving up passwords and privileges, which then lets hackers run riot all over your sensitive databases.
Deepfake porn videos have already been used to blackmail female reporters and journalists, such as Rana Ayyub in India, who exposes abuses of power. As the technology becomes cheaper, expect to see more uses of Deepfake to blackmail and defraud.
Legislation is already beginning to address the threats of Deepfake videos. For instance, in the state of California, two bills passed last year made aspects of Deepfake illegal - AB-602 banned the use of human image synthesis to make pornography without the consent of the people depicted and AB-730 banned manipulation of images of political candidates within 60 days of an election.
But is this going far enough? Fortunately, cyber-security companies are coming up with more and better detection algorithms all the time. These analyze the video image and spot the tiny distortions which are created in the ‘faking’ process. For instance, current Deepfake synthesizers model a 2D face, and then distort it to fit the 3D perspective of the video; looking at which way the nose is pointing is a key giveaway.
Deepfake videos are still at a stage where you can spot the signs yourself. Look for the following characteristics of a Deepfake video:
But as Deepfakes get better, you'll get less help from your own eyes and more from a good cyber-security program.
Some emerging technologies are now helping video makers authenticate their videos. A cryptographic algorithm can be used to insert hashes at set intervals during the video; if the video is altered, the hashes will change. AI and blockchain can register a tamper-proof digital fingerprint for videos. It's similar to watermarking documents; the difficulty with video is that the hashes need to survive if the video is compressed for use with different codecs.
Another way to repel Deepfake attempts is to use a program that inserts specially designed digital ‘artifacts’ into videos to conceal the patterns of pixels that face detection software uses. These then slow down Deepfake algorithms and lead to poor quality results — making the chances of successful Deepfaking less likely.
But technology isn't the only way to protect against Deepfake videos. Good basic security procedures are remarkably efficient at countering Deepfake.
For instance, having automatic checks built into any process for disbursing funds would have stopped many Deepfake and similar frauds. You can also:
Remember that if Deepfake starts to be deployed by hackers in their attempts to break into home and business networks, then basic cyber-security best practice will play a vital role when it comes to minimizing the risk:
Deepfake keeps evolving. Two years ago, it was really easy to tell Deepfake videos by the clunky quality of the movement and the fact that the faked person never seemed to blink. But the latest generation of fake videos has evolved and adapted.
There are estimated to be over 15,000 Deepfake videos out there right now. Some are just for fun, while others are trying to manipulate your opinions. But now that it only takes a day or two to make a new Deepfake, that number could rise very rapidly.

Ensure employees and family know about how Deepfaking works and the challenges it can pose.
Educate yourself and others on how to spot a Deepfake.
Make sure you are media literate and use good quality news sources.
Have good basic protocols - ""trust but verify"". A skeptical attitude to voicemail and videos won't guarantee you'll never be deceived, but it can help you avoid many traps.
Regular backups protect your data against ransomware and gives you the ability to restore damaged data.
Using different, strong passwords for different accounts means just because one network or service has been broken into doesn't mean any others have been compromised. If someone gets into your Facebook account, you don't want them to be able to get into your other accounts as well.
Use a good security package such as Kaspersky's Kaspersky Premium to protect your home network, laptop and smartphone against cyber threats. This package provides anti-virus software, a VPN to stop your Wi-Fi connections being hacked, and protection for your webcams, as well.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
The Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a compact, fast and useful laptop that offers great performance for everyday tasks for everyone in the family due to its portability, let me further explain. The Chromebook 311 has a nice 11.6 inch screen, and it is perfect for movability. It is also lightweight just less than 3 lbs. so it is easy to carry around, either at home, class or maybe at a favorite spot. I like how it feels, it feels sturdy and durable all around and it can withstand minor bumps and drops. It is powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and it has 4GB of RAM, so it easily handles everyday tasks like web browsing, word processing, and streaming best of all it does it well. It works great wirelessly, using Wi-Fi connection all around the house it has worked flawlessly. It does have an HD Webcam with dual built in speakers so our kids can take an online class or just to communicate with others, and it does come with a webcam cover for privacy. Another thing we like about the Chromebook is its good battery life. It can last up to 8 hours on a single charge and that is plenty for most people including our kids at home as well as us adults. Since the Chromebook runs on Chrome OS, it is like having my Android cell phone with a bigger screen, keyboard and touchpad which they are responsive and comfortable to use by the way. The system is easy to use and I can access my Google Drive, Google Docs as well as other applications from the Google App store. Overall, the Acer Chromebook 311 CBOA311-1H-C90F is a great choice for family like ours, that we can share it since it is very portable and reliable for everyday use. Now that the kids have recently returned to school, they are ready to use the Chromebook too.

Rated 5 out of 5 stars
I am quite pleased with the newest Acer 311. The build quality is decent despite being all plastic. That makes it lighter and more portable. The screen can lay 180° flat, stays up, and does not wobble. The keys have very good travel and feel very tactile. The trackpad is plastic but has a nice feel and is clicky. The bezels are bigger than I’d prefer, making the 11.6” display seem smaller. The HD (1366 x 768) screen has acceptable brightness but is a bit washed out and has pretty bad viewing angles. Nevertheless, I can see all text, graphics, and vide clearly. Sadly, there is no touchscreen support. The sound is what you’d expect from a small laptop. OK volume, clear, but no bass whatsoever. About connectivity, we have a USB-C 3.2 and a USB-A 3.1 port. The USB-C doubles as a power delivery and display port. The laptop is Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth compatible and works well and fast. There’s also a 3.8mm audio headphone jack. The N4500 CPU, Intel UHD Graphics, 4GB LPDDR4X memory combined make for a very smooth Chromebook workflow. I had several internet tabs open, (within reason), watched video, did productivity work, played super-basic games, and yes, streamed games with relatively no issues or slowdown. I did notice the laptop got bit warm but nothing uncomfortable and the fans were not loud at all. The 64GB storage is low but considering that this is designed to be used with cloud support, makes it sufficient. The battery life ranges between 8-10 hours depending on the use -good enough for a full workday. The 720P webcam is nothing to write home about but good enough for those basic video calls. I appreciate the included security cam cover. In the end, I think this Chromebook is quite portable and capable of handling everyday tasks. It’s perfect for student use and for anyone that is looking for simplicity and security. While the price could have been a bit lower, this is a great budget option.

This is a basic Chromebook, without any frills. But if your needs are limited, it does get the job done. == Build Quality == The packaging is minimal and without frills, but that is OK as I would rather the money go towards the computer than something that will be thrown away. Once you open up the machine itself, it seems to be decently built. It is all plastic construction, but you expect that for this price. The bottom features no air vents at all, and this machine has no moving parts; not even a single fan. But given the limited power, this is perfectly acceptable, and means that there is less to break in the future. == Peripherals == Being a budget device, the name of the game is giving you basic functionality for as little money as possible, and this has been done well. Obviously some corners were cut, but nothing was cut back in such a way that caused any problems. Everything here falls squarely in the “usable but not impressive” category. The keyboard is acceptable. It works and feels good, but it is not backlit at all. The trackpad is also well done, despite having a plastic surface. Multi-touch gestures also work well, but it is not especially smooth or gigantic. But it is adequate, and that is enough for this type of machine. There is a camera above the display that is more than good enough for Zoom or Teams meetings, and although it lacks a privacy shutter, Acer thought to include a slim self-adhesive shutter in the package that you can apply if you desire. The display itself is perhaps a little disappointing, being only 1366 by 768, and the contrast and brightness are nothing special. Of note is that the color seems to shift a little bit as you move your head from side to side, but once again, higher quality brings higher prices, and this display is certainly usable. But the largest surprise is that the speakers are surprisingly good given the size and price. There is actually more bass and volume than I expected. As to the included IO, other than the expected BlueTooth and WiFi, it features a single USB-A rated for up to 5Mbps, one 3.5mm audio jack, and a single USB-C port that is used for charging, adding external devices, and can do video out. This computer had no problems driving an external 3440 by 1440 display, if that is the sort of thing that you need. A USB-C power supply is included, but this can use any USB-C charger large enough to drive a laptop. Note that there is nothing inside that is upgradable. Everything is soldered down to the main board. == Performance == They say that it is what is inside that counts, and this does not have much inside, but for many it will be enough. This Chromebook uses a dual-core x86 processor backed up by 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of flash storage. Note that there is no way to expand anything; neither RAM nor SSD. The performance is perfectly OK for light office tasks. Google Docs and Google Sheets both work well, as do the Chrome and Firefox browsers. Sometimes the Firefox browser seemed a little sluggish when starting up or trying to type in a new URL, but they got the job done, even though I had to wait a second or two longer than I was accustomed to. Also inside is a 33 WH battery, which gives around seven hours of life away from a charger with light usage. == Software == The thing about a Chromebook is that it is a Chromebook. You are limited in the apps that you can run. But with that being understood, it can run most Android apps. I had no problems installing Google Docs and Sheets, and Microsoft Teams installed easily, as well as BitWarden password manager. The only issues that I encountered were that I could not install Microsoft Outlook, and the Amazon shopping app (but Amazon Prime Video was not a problem). There is also an option to get a Linux terminal window up, but I am not sure how useful that will be to most people in the market for this type of computer. == Summary == This is a machine with several compromises, but it is built to hit an affordable price point. If you need a Chromebook, and this is a machine that you can afford, then it is worthy of consideration. All of the compromises are acceptable, and none of them are deal-breakers.

There is also an option to get a Linux terminal window up, but I am not sure how useful that will be to most people in the market for this type of computer. == Summary == This is a machine with several compromises, but it is built to hit an affordable price point. If you need a Chromebook, and this is a machine that you can afford, then it is worthy of consideration. All of the compromises are acceptable, and none of them are deal-breakers.Read More Posted 2 months ago by Harrkev

Stay on top of the latest fashion trends with Old Navy's collection of women's blouses. Our blouses for women range from frilly floral-print styles to sensible button-front shirts. At Old Navy, we think women’s blouses should feel as great as they look. You’ll find that our blouses are not only super-stylish, they super-soft and classically comfortable, too, made with cool, crisp cotton, lightweight linen, cozy knits or silky woven fabrics. We offer a vast variety of different blouses for whatever the weather throws your way. Go for a lightweight sleeveless blouse, cool cami style or breezy flutter-sleeve blouse for hotter temperatures. Soak up the sun in an off-the-shoulder Bardot blouse or the latest cold-shoulder blouses. When the weather cools down, we have long-sleeved blouses and long-sleeved button-front shirts. Our workwear utility shirts are made from durable, comfortable twill or denim with practical pockets at the chest. Old Navy’s blouses are versatile enough to make a chic impression at the office or on the town and come in different necklines and sleeve lengths to suit every woman’s style. Fashion-forward details like smocking, soft ruffles, keyhole bodices and tassel ties add eye-catching allure to your favorite blouses. From solid color staples like black and white to trending tie-dye, camo and boho-inspired floral prints, you’re sure to find women’s blouses at Old Navy to match your every mood.
